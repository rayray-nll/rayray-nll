Both have now moved on to do other things, and enjoy a \\nwell-earned rest from authorship. In this book, I am joined by a Nephrologist, Gas-\\ntroenterologist, and trainees destined for careers in Cardiology, Dermatology, and \\nGeneral Practice. Five physicians, each with very diff erent interests and approaches, \\nyet bringing their own knowledge, expertise, and styles. When combined with that \\nof our specialist and junior readers, I hope this creates a book that is greater than \\nthe sum of its parts, yet true to the original concept and ethos of the original authors. \\nLife and medicine have moved on in the \\n30 years since the ﬁ rst edition was published, \\nbut medicine and science are largely iterative; true novel ‘ground-breaking’ or ‘prac-\\ntice-changing’ discoveries are rare, to quote Isaac Newton: ‘If I have seen further, it \\nis by standing on the shoulders of giants’. Therefore, when we set about writing this \\nedition we drew inspiration from the original book and its authors; updating, adding, \\nand clarifying, but trying to retain the unique feel and perspective that the \\nOHCM has \\nprovided to generations of trainees and clinicians.\\nIBW, 2017\\nWe wrote this book not because we know so much, but because we know we \\nremember so little…the problem is not simply the quantity of information, but the \\ndiversity of places from which it is dispensed. Trailing eagerly behind the surgeon, \\nthe student is admonished never to forget alcohol withdrawal as a cause of post-\\noperative confusion. The scrap of paper on which this is written spends a month \\nin the pocket before being lost for ever in the laundry. At diff erent times, and in \\ninconvenient places, a number of other causes may be presented to the student. \\nNot only are these causes and aphorisms never brought together, but when, as a \\nsurgical house offi  cer, the former student faces a confused patient, none is to hand.\\nWe aim to encourage the doctor to enjoy his patients: in doing so we believe he \\nwill prosper in the practice of medicine. For a long time now, house offi  cers have \\nbeen encouraged to adopt monstrous proportions in order to straddle the diverse \\npinnacles of clinical science and clinical experience. We hope that this book will \\nmake this endeavour a little easier by moving a cumulative memory burden from \\nthe mind into the pocket, and by removing some of the fears that are naturally felt \\nwhen starting a career in medicine, thereby freely allowing the doctor’s clinical \\nacumen to grow by the slow accretion of many, many days and nights.\\nRA Hope and JM Longmore, \\n1985\\nPreface to the ﬁ rst edition\\n_OHCM_10e.indb   iv_OHCM_10e.indb   iv 02/05/2017   19:0602/05/2017   19:06'),\n",

Is it adequate to address \\nthe scientiﬁ c, political, social, and economic realities that exist for doctors today? \\nCertainly, medical training without a fee appears to have been conﬁ ned to history. \\nYet it remains one of the oldest binding documents in history and its principles of \\ncommitment, ethics, justice, professionalism, and conﬁ  dentiality transcend time.\\nThe absence of autonomy as a fundamental tenet of modern medical care can \\nbe debated. But just as anatomy and physiology have been added to the doctor’s \\nrepertoire since Hippocrates, omissions should not undermine the oath as a para-\\ndigm of self-regulation amongst a group of specialists committed to an ideal. And \\ndo not forget that illness may represent a temporary loss of autonomy caused by \\nfear, vulnerability, and a subjective weighting of present versus future. It could \\nbe argued that Hippocratic paternalism is, in fact, required to restore autonomy.\\nContemporary versions of the oath often fail to make doctors accountable for \\nkeeping to any aspect of the pledge. And beware the oath that is nothing more \\nthan historic ritual without accountability, for then it can be superseded by per-\\nsonal, political, social, or economic priorities:\\n‘In Auschwitz, doctors presided over the murder of most of the one million \\nvictims….

Rather, \\nit is believed to allude to the common practice of using doctors as political assassins.\\n2 Abortion by oral methods was legal in ancient Greece. The oath cautions only against the use of pessaries \\nas a potential source of lethal infection.\\n3 The oath does not disavow surgery, merely asks the physician to cede to others with expertise.\\n_OHCM_10e.indb   1_OHCM_10e.indb   1 02/05/2017   19:0602/05/2017   19:06'),\n",

It is a profession \\nwhere exact measurement is not easy and the absence of it opens the mind to \\nendless conjecture as to the efﬁ  cacy of this or that form of treatment.’\\nAneurin Bevan, In Place of Fear, 1952.\\nA QALY is a quality-adjusted life year. One year of healthy life expectancy = 1 QALY, \\nwhereas 1 year of unhealthy life expectancy is worth <1 QALY, the precise value falling \\nwith progressively worsening quality of life. If an intervention means that you are \\nlikely to live for \\n8 years in perfect health then that intervention would have a QALY \\nvalue of 8. If a new drug improves your quality of life from 0.5 to 0.7 for 25 years, \\nthen it has a QALY value of (0.7 Ω 0.5)≈25=5. Based on the price of the intervention, the \\ncost of 1 QALY can be calculated. Healthcare priorities can then be weighted towards \\nlow cost QALYs. The National Institute for Health and Care Excellence (NICE) consid-\\ners that interventions for which 1 QALY=<£30 000 are cost-eff ective. However, as a \\npractical application of utilitarian theory, QALYs remain open to criticism (table 1.1). \\nRemember that although for a clinician, time is unambiguous and quantiﬁ able, time \\nexperienced by patients is more like literature than science: a minute might be a \\nchapter, a year a single sentence.\\n3\\nTable 1.1 The advantages and disadvantages of QALYs\\nAdvantages Disadvantages\\nTransparent societal decision \\nmaking\\nF ocuses on slice (disease), not pie (health)\\nCommon unit for diff erent \\ninterventions \\nBased on a value judgement that living longer is a \\nmeasure of success\\nAllows cost-eff ectiveness \\nanalysis\\nQuality of life assessment comes from general public, \\nnot those with disease\\nAllows international comparison Potentially ageist\\n—the elderly always have less ‘life \\nexpectancy’ to gain\\nFocus on outcomes, not process ie care, compassion\\nThe inverse care law, equity, and distributive justice:\\nThe inverse care law states that the availability of good medical care varies inversely \\nwith the need f\\nor it. This arises due to poorer quality services, barriers to service ac-\\ncess, and external disadvantage. By focusing on the beneﬁ  t gained from an interven-\\ntion, the \\nQALY system treats everyone as equal. But is this really equality? Distributive \\njustice is the distribution of ‘goods’ so that those who are worst off  become better \\noff . In healthcare terms, this means allocation of resources to those in greatest need, \\nregardless of QALYs.\\nThe importance of compassion4,5 in medicine is undisputed. It is an emotional re-\\nsponse to negativity or suff ering that motivates a desire to help. It is more than \\n‘pity’, which has connotations of inferiority; and diff  erent from ‘empathy’, which is \\na vicarious experience of the emotional state of another. It requires imaginative \\nindwelling into another’s condition.

You \\nspend an hour asking all the wr\\nong questions, and in waltzes a doctor who names \\nthe disease before you have even ﬁ  nished taking the pulse. This doctor has simply \\nrecognized the illness like he recognizes an old friend (or enemy).\\nDiagnosing by probability:  Over our clinical lives we build up a personal database \\no\\nf diagnoses and associated pitfalls. We unconsciously run each new ‘case’ through \\nthis continuously developing probabilistic algorithm with increasing speed and ef-\\nfortlessness.\\nDiagnosing by reasoning: Like Sherlock Holmes, we must exclude each diff er ential, \\nand the diagnosis is what remains. This is dependent on the quality of the diff erential \\nand presupposes methods for absolutely excluding diseases. All tests are statistical \\nrather than absolute (5% of the population lie outside the ‘normal’ range), which is \\nwhy this method remains, like Sherlock Holmes, ﬁ ctional at best.\\nDiagnosing by watching and waiting:  The dangers and expense of exhaustive tests \\nma\\ny be obviated by the skilful use of time.\\nDiagnosing by selective doubting:  Diagnosis relies on clinical signs and investiga-\\ntiv\\ne tests. Yet there are no hard signs or perfect tests. When diagnosis is diffi  cult, try \\ndoubting the signs, then doubting the tests. But the game of medicine is unplayable \\nif you doubt everything: so doubt selectively.\\nDiagnosis by iteration and reiteration:  A brief history suggests looking for a few \\nsigns, which leads t\\no further questions and a few tests. As the process reiterates, \\nvarious diagnostic possibilities crop up, leading to further questions and further \\ntests. And so history taking and diagnosing never end.\\nHeuristic pitfalls\\nHeuristics are the cognitive shortcuts which allow quick decision-making by focus-\\ning on r\\nelevant predictors. Be aware of them so you can be vigilant of their traps.7\\nRepresentativeness:  Diagnosis is driven by the ‘classic case’. Do not forget the \\nat\\nypical variant.\\nAvailability: The diseases that we remember, or treated most recently, carry more \\nw\\neight in our diagnostic hierarchy. Question whether this more readily available \\ninformation is truly relevant.\\nOverconﬁ dence: Are you overestimating how much you know and how well you \\nkno\\nw it? Probably.\\nBias: The hunt for, and recall of, clinical information that ﬁ  ts with our expectations. \\nCan you disprove your own diagnostic hypothesis?\\nIllusory correlation: Associated events are presumed to be causal. But was it treat-\\nment or time that cur\\ned the patient?\\nConsider three wise men:6\\nOccam’s razor: Entia non sunt multiplicanda praeter necessitatem translates as \\n‘entities must not be multiplied unnecessarily’. The physician should therefore seek \\nto achieve diagnostic parsimony and ﬁ nd a single disease to explain all symptoms, \\nrather than proff er two or three unrelated diagnoses.\\nHickam’s dictum: P\\natients can have as many diagnoses as they damn well \\nplease. Signs and symptoms may be due to more than one pathology. Indeed, a \\npatient is statistically more likely to have two common diagnoses than one unify-\\ning rare condition.\\nCrabtree’s bludgeon:\\n No set of mutually inconsistent observations can exist for \\nwhich some human intellect cannot conceive a coherent explanation however \\ncomplicated. This acts as a reminder that physicians prefer Occam to Hickam: a \\nunifying diagnosis is a much more pleasing thing.

Such error-blindness is why ‘I am wrong’ is a statement of impos-\\nsibility. Once you are aware that you are wrong, you are no longer wrong, and can \\ntherefore only declare ‘I was wrong’. It is also the reason that fallibility must be \\naccepted as a universally human phenomenon. Conversely, certainty is the convic-\\ntion that we cannot be wrong because our biases and beliefs must be grounded \\nin fact. Certainty produces the comforting illusion that the world (and medicine) \\nis knowable. But be cautious of certainty for it involves a shift in perspective \\ninwards, towards our own convictions. This means that other people’s stories can \\ncease to matter to us. Certainty becomes lethal to empathy.\\nIn order to determine how and why mistakes are made, error must be acknowl-\\nedged and accepted. Defensiveness is bad for progress. ‘I was wrong, but...’ is \\nrarely an open and honest analysis of error that will facilitate diff erent and better \\naction in the future. It is only with close scrutiny of mistakes that you can see the \\npossibility of change at the core of error. And yet, medical practice is littered with \\nexamples of resistance to disclosure, and reward for the concealment of error. \\nThis must change.\\n4 Remember error blindness and protect your whistle-blowers. \\nListen. It is an act of humility that acknowledges the position of others, and the \\npossibility of error in yourself. Knowledge persists only until it can be disproved. \\nBetter to aspire to the aporia of Socrates:\\n‘At ﬁ rst, he didn’t know...just as he doesn’t yet know the answer now either; \\nbut he still thought he knew the answer then, and he was answering con-\\nﬁ dently, as if he had knowledge. He didn’t think he was stuck before, but \\nnow he appreciates that he is stuck...At any rate, it would seem that we’ve \\nincreased his chances of ﬁ  nding out the truth of the matter, because now, \\ngiven his lack of knowledge, he’ll be glad to undertake the investigation...Do \\nyou think he’d have tried to enquire or learn about this matter when he thought \\nhe knew it (even though he didn’t), until he’d become bogged down and stuck, \\nand had come to appreciate his ignorance and to long for knowledge?’\\nPlato: Meno and other dialogues, 402 BC; Waterﬁ eld translation, 2005.\\nBeing wrong\\nIn a world in which a ‘mistake’ can be redeﬁ ned as a ‘complication’, it is easy to \\nconceal error behind a veil of technical language. In 2014, a professional duty of \\ncandour became statutory in England for incidents that cause death, severe or \\nmoderate harm, or prolonged psychological harm. As soon as practicable, the pa-\\ntient must be told in person what happened, given details of further enquiries, and \\noff ered an apology. But this should not lead to the proff ering of a ‘tick-box’ apology \\nof questionable value. Be reassured that an apology is not an admission of liability. \\nRisks and imperfections are inherent to medicine and you have the freedom to \\nbe sorry whenever they occur. Focus not on legislation, but on transparency and \\nlearning. The ethics of forgiveness require a complete response in which the pa-\\ntient’s voice is placed at the heart of the process.\\n9\\nDuty of candour\\nError provides a link between medicine and the humanities. Both strive to bridge \\nthe gap between ourselves and the world. Medicine attempts to do this in an ob-\\njective manner, using disproved hypotheses (error) to progress towards a ‘truth’. \\nArt, however, accepts the unknown, and celebrates transience and subjectivity. \\nBy seeing the world through someone else’s eyes, art teaches us empathy. It is at \\nthe point where art and medicine collide that doctors can re-attach themselves \\nto the human race and feel those emotions that motivate or terrify our patients. \\n‘Unknowing’ drives medical theory, but also stories and pictures. And these are the \\nhallmark of our highest endeavours.\\n‘We all know that Art is not truth.

At the start of his professional life he was advised that the best way \\nto get business was to pretend to have it. It was suggested that a note marked ‘Im-\\nmediate and pressing’ should be ostentatiously handed to him at the dinner table, \\nbut always at a suitable time so as not to miss the best food. Such advice was not \\ntaken. Corrigan aspired to hard work and taught his students the value of ‘never \\ndoing nothing’. The city in which he practised had a ‘degree of ﬁ lth, stench and dark-\\nness, inconceivable by those who have not experienced them’, and ‘not enough hos-\\npital beds to care for the great numbers in need.’ And so the story of a secret door, \\nmade in his consulting room, to escape the ever growing queue of eager patients.\\nIn times of chaos, ﬁ  lled with competing, urgent, simultaneous demands, excessive \\npaperwork, too few beds, eff ort\\n–reward imbalance, personal sacriﬁ  ce, and despair; \\nwe all need Corrigan to take us by the shadow of our hand, and walk with us through \\na secret door into a calm inner world.

Most death is the end product of \\na struggle with long-term, progressive disease: cancer, COPD, vascular disease, neu-\\nrological deterioration, frailty, or dementia. Although death is inevitable, prognos-\\ntication is diffi   cult and inaccurate with remarkable variation in time to death.

What is unacceptable to them?\\n  • Consider the views of those important to the patient.\\n  • Hydration: give support to allow the dying to drink, off er mouth car e. Consider \\nclinically assisted hydration (parenteral, enteral, intravenous) according to wish-\\nes and if distressing signs/symptoms of dehydration are possible.

Donors give their explicit consent\\n  • Opt-out. An yone who has not actively refused consent is a donor.\\nThe association bet\\nween an opt-out system and higher organ donation rates is \\ncomplicated by the presence of multiple cofounding factors. Non-legislative change \\nincluding national coordination, support and training of clinicians, routine discussion \\nas part of end-of-life care, and effi  cient organ retrieval also increase donation rates. \\nThe ethics of presumed consent should also be considered: the absence of an objec-\\ntion would not be an acceptable substitute for informed consent in other areas of \\nclinical practice.\\nIn the \\nUK, although consent for transplantation rests with the deceased, if the \\npatient’s family or representative cannot support donation then it will not go ahead. \\nRegister your decision on the \\nNHS Organ Donor Register ( https://www.organdonation.\\nnhs.uk/register-to-donate/register-your-details/) and more importantly, let your family know \\nyour wishes.\\n_OHCM_10e.indb   13_OHCM_10e.indb   13 02/05/2017   19:0602/05/2017   19:06'),\n",

We hope for moral perception: to be able to visualize the \\nmorally salient features of a situation. For without this, ethical issues may ﬂ oat past \\nnever to be resolved.

It elucidates risks and mechanisms for the development of disease, and re-\\nveals potential targets for disease prevention and treatment. Epidemiology does not \\nlook at the individual patient, but examines a deﬁ ned population. How applicable its \\nﬁ ndings are depend upon how well the sample population mirrors the study popula-\\ntion, which must, in turn, mirr\\nor the target population. Does your patient ﬁ t in this \\n‘target’? If ‘yes’, then the epidemiological ﬁ ndings may be applicable.\\nMeasures of disease frequency\\nIncidence pr\\noportion is the number of new cases of disease as a proportion of \\nthe population. Synon\\nyms include probability of disease, cumulative incidence, risk.\\nIncidence rate is the number of new cases per unit of person-time, ie one person \\nobserv\\ned for 5 years contributes 5 person-years of follow-up.\\nPrevalence is the number of cases that exist at a given time (point prevalence) or \\ntime-fr\\name (period prevalence), divided by the total population being studied. For \\nexample, the lifetime prevalence of hiccups is ~100% and incidence is millions/year. \\nHowever, the point prevalence at 3am may be 0 if no one is actually having hiccups.\\nComparisons of outcome frequency\\nDiff erences in outcome rates between populations point to an association between \\nthe out\\ncome and factors distinguishing the populations (eg a smoking population \\ncompared to a non-smoking population). Challenges arise as populations tend to \\ndiff er from each other in many ways, so it may not be clear which factor(s) aff ect \\noutcome frequency. This leads to  confounding. For example, we might ﬁ  nd that \\nheart disease is more common in those who use walking sticks. But we cannot con-\\nclude that walking sticks cause heart disease as age is a confounding factor: age is \\ncausal, not walking sticks.\\nWays of accounting for associations:  \\nA may cause B (antacids cause cancer), B may \\ncause A (cancer causes antacid use), a 3rd unknown agent X (eg age) may cause A \\nand B, or the association may be a chance ﬁ nding. When considering the options, it \\nis useful to bear in mind the Bradford Hill ‘criteria’ for causation (NB he did not claim \\nany were essential):\\n1       Consistency of ﬁ ndings: among diff erent populations, studies, time periods.\\n2       Temporality: the eff ect must occur after the cause.\\n3       Biological gradient: a dose response whereby more exposure = more eff ect.\\n4       Speciﬁ city: exposure causes a single outcome (smoking does not conform!).\\n5       Strength of association: strong associations are more likely to be causal.\\n6       Biological plausibility: there is a mechanism linking cause and eff ect.\\n7       Coherence: the relationship is supported by current disease knowledge.\\n8       Experiment: does removal of exposure reduce outcome frequency?\\nEpidemiological studies\\nStudies should be designed to give an adequate answer to a speciﬁ c research ques-\\ntion. Samples need to be representative and of suffi   cient size to answer the question.\\nEcological studies: Outcome rates are examined in diff erent populations, eg trend \\nover time, geographically distinct groups, social class. Populations rather than indi-\\nviduals are the unit of study.\\nLongitudinal (cohort) studies: Subjects are followed over time with measurement \\no\\nf exposure and outcome.\\nCase–control studies: Patients with the outcome of interest are identiﬁ ed and past \\nexposure is assessed in comparison to ‘controls’ who did not develop the outcome. \\nCases and controls should be adequately matched for other factors that may aff ect \\noutcome, or these diff erences should be corrected for (mathematical assumption).\\nExperimental studies: Exposure is allocated to a study group and compared to \\nthose who ar\\ne not exposed, eg randomized controlled trials.\\n_OHCM_10e.indb   18_OHCM_10e.indb   18 02/05/2017   19:0602/05/2017   19:06'),\n",

It is speciﬁ c to the chosen comparator (eg placebo or usual \\ncare), the measured outcome (eg death, blood pressure fall), and the duration of \\ntreatment follow-up used in the study. Look carefully at the details of the question \\nthat the\\n NNT is attempting to quantify.\\n  • Advantages: easily calculated, single numerical value for effi  cacy , can be used to \\nexamine harm (becomes the number needed to harm).\\n  • Disadvantages: conﬁ dence intervals are diffi   cult when the diff erences between \\ntreatments are not signiﬁ cant. \\nYes or No? Your tutor asks whether Gobble’s disease is commoner in women or \\nmen. Y\\nou have no idea, and make a guess. What is the chance of getting it right? \\nCommon sense decrees that you have a 50:50 chance. Sod’s law predicts that \\nwhatever you guess, you will always be wrong. Somewhere between the two is \\nDamon Runyon’s view that ‘all life is \\n6 to 5 against’: Will you pick the right answer? \\nPerhaps, but don’t bet on it!\\nNew or existing disease? Suppose singultus is a rare symptom of Gobble’s dis-\\nease (seen in 5% of patients), but that it is a very common symptom of Kobble’s \\ndisease (seen in 90%). If we have a man whom we already know has Gobble’s \\ndisease, who goes on to develop singultus, is it more likely to be due to Kobble’s, \\nrather than Gobble’s disease? The answer is usually no: it is generally the case that \\nmost symptoms are due to a disease that is already known, and do not imply a \\nnew disease (Occam’s razor, p\\n4). The ‘odds ratio’ makes this clearer, ie the ratio \\nof [the probability of the symptom, given the known disease] to [the probability \\nof the symptom due to new disease ≈ the probability of developing the new dis-\\nease]. Usually this is vastly in favour of the symptom being due to the old disease, \\nbecause of the prior odds of the two diseases. This will work until Kobble’s dis-\\nease increases in prevalence so as to increase the odds of a second disease (then \\nHickam trumps Occam, p\\n4).\\nHow to play the odds It is distasteful to think that doctors can gamble with \\npatients’ liv\\nes. It is also distasteful to think of serious diseases being ‘missed’, and \\ninvasive procedures being done unnecessarily. Yet we do not have an evidence \\nbase or an experience base which can tell us deﬁ nitively which cough or lethargy \\nor sore toe is just ‘one of those things’, and which is the result of undiagnosed \\ncancer or \\nHIV or osteomyelitis. And so we gamble.\\nMedicine is not for pessimists—almost anything can be made to seem fatal, so \\nthat a pessimistic doctor would never get any sleep at night due to worry about \\nthe meaning of their patients’ symptoms. Medicine is not for blind optimists either, \\nwho too easily embrace a fool’s paradise of false reassurance. Rather, medicine is \\nfor informed gamblers: gamblers who are happy to use subtle clues to change their \\noutlook from pessimism to optimism and vice versa. Sometimes the gambling is \\nscientiﬁ c, rational, methodical, and reproducible (odds ratio); sometimes it instinc-\\ntual, due to clinical intuition (vital but ill-deﬁ ned).\\nOf course, gambling inevitably results in losses, and in medicine the chips are \\nnot just ﬁ nancial. They betoken the health of your patient, your reputation, and \\nyour conﬁ  dence. Perhaps the hardest part of medicine is the inevitability of making \\nmistakes whilst attempting to help (see ‘Being wrong’, p\\n5). But do not worry about \\ngambling: gambling is your job. If you cannot gamble, you cannot walk the thin line \\nbetween successfully addressing health needs, and causing over-medicalization \\n(p\\n23).

What do w e want? The science, the \\nrigour, the truth, or what will be most useful to patients? These may overlap, but \\nthey are not the same. Can average cohort results inform clinical decisions on an \\nindividual level (especially in the context of comorbidity)?\\n  • Can we really appraise ALL the evidence? 27 We are hindered by publication bias. \\nAround half of all clinical trials remain unpublished. See www.alltrials.net for the cam-\\npaign to register all trials, and ensure methods and summary results are available.\\n  • Evidence can be expensive. Who paid the bill and what is their vested interest?\\n  • Is the result clinically signiﬁ  cant? What is the level of beneﬁ t to the individual, as \\nopposed to the population? Is the EBM tail wagging the clinical dog?\\n  • How is our innate hierarchy of evidence constructed? Do we maintain the same \\nstandard of the evidence for all changes to our practice? \\n  • Have you checked the correspondence columns in journals from which winning \\npapers are extracted? It may take years for unforeseen ﬂ aws to surface.\\n  • There is a danger that by always asking, ‘What is the evidence?’, we will divert \\nresources from hard-to-prove areas (eg psychosocial interventions).\\n  • EBM is never 100% up to date and reworking meta-analyses takes time and mon-\\ney. Specialists may ostensibly reject a new trial due to a tiny ﬂ aw, when the real \\ndread is that it might ﬂ ip their once-perfect formulation.\\n  • EBM lies uncomfortably in a world of clinical intuition and instinctual premoni-\\ntion. Yet these instincts may be vital.\\n  • If EBM is prescriptive, patient choice declines. Does our zeal for EBM make us ar-\\nrogant, mechanical, and defensive? Where is the shared decision-making (p7)?\\n  • By focusing on answerable questions, EBM can distract us from our patients’ un-\\nanswerable questions; questions that still require time and acknowledgement.\\n\\ue007The practice of EBM must be informed by clinical judgement and compassion.\\nFig 1.3 Hierarchy of evidence.\\nEBM Pyramid and EBM Page Generator, copyright 2006 Trustees of \\nDartmouth College and Yale University.\\n_OHCM_10e.indb   22_OHCM_10e.indb   22 02/05/2017   19:0602/05/2017   19:06'),\n",

This chapter is not a substitute for this process: it \\nis simply an aide-memoire both on the wards and when preparing for exams.\\n2       We ask questions to get information to help with diff erential diagnosis. But we \\nalso ask questions to ﬁ nd out about the lives our patients live so that we can \\nrespect them as individuals. The patient is likely to notice and reciprocate this \\nrespect, and the rapport that you build with your patient in this way is a key com-\\nponent to diagnosing and managing their disease.\\n3       Patients (and diseases) rarely read textbooks, so don’t be surprised that some \\ns\\nymptoms are ambiguous, and others meaningless. Get good at recognizing pat-\\nterns, but not so good that you create them when none exist. We all fall into this \\ntrap!\\n4       Signs can be easy to detect, or subtle. Some will be found by all the new medical \\nstudents, o\\nthers require experienced ears or eyes. Remember, you can be a ﬁ  ne \\ndoctor without being able to elicit every sign .1 However, ﬁ  nding signs and put-\\nting together the clues they give us to ﬁ  nd a diagnosis is one of the best parts of \\nbeing a doctor. It is also essential that we learn those signs that highlight diseases \\nwe should never miss. However, in an exam, if you cannot ﬁ  nd a sign, never be \\ntempted to make up something you think should be there. If the examiner is push-\\ning you to describe something you cannot see, be honest and admit you cannot \\nsee it. Learning is a lifelong process, and nobody becomes a consultant overnight.\\nAdvice and experience\\nHaving a template for the all-important history and examination is no more than a \\nrough guide and you must ﬂ esh it out with your own learning. We start out nerv-\\nous of missing some question or sign, but what we should really be nervous about \\nis losing our humanity in the hurly-burly of a time-pressed interview. Here is how \\none student put some ﬂ esh on the bones\\n—for a man in a wheelchair: she asked \\nall about the presenting complaint, and how it ﬁ  tted in with his CNS condition and \\nlife at home—and then found out that his daughter had had a nervous breakdown \\nat the start of his illness, 5 years ago. ‘How is she now?’ she asked. ‘Fine—I’ve got \\ntwo lovely grand children…Jim is just learning to walk…’ ‘Oh…you must be so busy!’ \\nthe student said with a joyful smile. This man had not been busy for 5 years, and \\nwas fed up with his passive dependency. The thought of being busy again made \\nhis face light up\\n—and when the student left he rose up out of his wheelchair to \\nshake her by the hand, a movement we doctors thought was impossible. Jim and \\nhis grandfather were learning to walk, but this student was up and running\\n—far \\nahead of her teachers.\\nAn insightful student\\nWhile on the acute medical or surgical take you will ‘clerk’ countless numbers of \\npatients. This involves taking a full history: history-taking may seem deceptively \\neasy, as if the patient knew the hard facts and the only problem was extracting \\nthem; but what a patient says is a mixture of hearsay (‘She said I looked very pale’), \\ninnuendo (‘You know, doctor, down below’), legend (‘I suppose I bit my tongue; it \\nwas a real ﬁ t, you know’), exaggeration (‘I didn’t sleep a wink’), and improbabilities \\n(‘The Pope put a transmitter in my brain’). The great skill (and pleasure) in taking \\na history lies not in ignoring these garbled messages, but in making sense of them. \\nNext you will likely perform all the core examinations (cardiovascular, respiratory, \\nabdominal, and neurological) and any relevant additional ones (eg breast, thyroid, \\nperipheral vascular). No two doctors will have identical examination techniques. \\nRelish this variation as it helps you craft your own routine.\\nDeveloping your own routine\\n_OHCM_10e.indb   25_OHCM_10e.indb   25 02/05/2017   19:0602/05/2017   19:06'),\n",

Do not rely on signs or investigations for your diagnosis, \\nbut use them rather to conﬁ rm what you suspected. Try to put the patient at ease: a \\ngood rapport may relieve distress. Introduce yourself and check whether the patient \\nis comfortable. Be conversational rather than interrogative.

What was the ﬁ  rst \\nthing no\\nticed? Progress since then. Ever had it before? ‘ SOCRATES’ questions: site; \\nonset (gradual, sudden); character; radiation; associations (eg nausea, sweating); \\ntiming of pain/duration; exacerbating and alleviating factors; severity (eg scale of \\n1–10, compared with worst ever previous pain). Direct questioning  (to narrow list of \\npossible diagnoses). Speciﬁ \\nc or ‘closed’ questions about the diff erential diagnoses \\nyou have in mind (+risk factors, eg travel—p414) and a review of the relevant system.\\nPast medical history (PMH) Ever in hospital? Illnesses? Operations? Ask speciﬁ -\\ncally about MIJTHREADS: MI, jaundice, TB, high BP, rheumatic fever, epilepsy, asthma, \\ndiabetes, stroke, anaesthetic problems.\\nDrug history (DH) Any tablets, injections, ‘over-the-counter’ drugs, herbal remedies, \\nor\\nal contraceptives? Ask about allergies and what the patient experienced, eg may \\nbe an int\\nolerance (nausea, diarrhoea), or may have been a minor reaction of sensiti-\\nzation (eg rash and wheeze) before full-blown anaphylaxis.\\nSocial history (SH) Probe without prying. ‘Who else is there at home?’ Job. Marital \\nstatus. Spouse’\\ns job and health. Housing—any stairs at home? Who visits—relatives, \\nneighbours, GP, nurse? Are there any dependants at home? Mobility —any walking \\naids needed? Who does the cooking and shopping? What can the patient not do be-\\ncause of the illness? Ask about occupation, hobbies, sport, exercise, and ethnic origin.\\nThe social history is all too often seen as a dispensable adjunct but vital clues may \\nbe missed about the quality of life and it is too late to ask when the surgeon’s hand is \\ndeep in the belly and they are wondering how radical a procedure to perform. Utilize \\nthe \\nGP’s knowledge of the patient: they may have known them and/or their family for \\ndecades. He or she may even hold a ‘living will’ or advance directive if they cannot \\nspeak for themselves. Tactfully ask about alcohol, tobacco, and recreational drugs. \\nHo\\nw much? How long? When stopped? 1 unit = 8g of ethanol = 1 spirits measure = 1/2 \\nglass of wine = 1/3 pint of beer. The CAGE questionnaire is a useful screening test for \\nalcoholism (p281). Quantify smoking in terms of pack-years: 20 cigarettes/day for 1 \\nyear equals 1 pack-year. We all like to present ourselves well, so be inclined to double \\nstated quantities (Holt’s ‘law’).\\nFamily history (FH) Areas of the family history may need detailed questioning, eg \\nt\\no determine if there is a signiﬁ cant family history of heart disease you need to ask \\nabout the health of the patient’s grandfathers and male siblings, smoking, tendency \\nto hypertension, hyperlipidaemia, and claudication before they were \\n60 years old, as \\nwell as ascertaining the cause of death.

It is increasingly im-\\nportant for doctors to identify patients at high risk of genetic disease, and to make \\nappropriate referrals. The key skill is drawing a family tree to help you structure \\na family history as follows:\\n1       Start with your patient. Draw a square for a male and a circle for a female. Add \\na small arrow (see ﬁ g 2.2) to show that this person is the propositus  (the person \\nthrough whom the family tree is ascertained).\\n2       Add your patient’s parents, brothers, and sisters. Record basic information only, \\neg age, and if alive and well (a&w). If dead, note age and cause of death, and \\npass an oblique stroke through that person’s symbol.\\n3       Ask the key question ‘Has anybody else in your family had a similar problem \\nas yourself?’, eg heart attack/angina/stroke/cancer. Ask only about the family \\nof diseases that relate to your patient’s main problem. Do not record a potted \\nmedical history for each family member: time is too short.\\n4       Extend the family tree upwards to include grandparents. If you haven’t revealed \\na problem by now, go no further —you are unlikely to miss important familial \\ndisease. If your patient is elderly it may be impossible to obtain good informa-\\ntion about grandparents. If so, ﬁ ll out the family tree with your patient’s uncles \\nand aunts on both the mother’s and father’s sides.\\n5       Shade those in the family tree aff ected by the disease. • = an aff ected female; \\n\\ue045 = an aff  ected male. This helps to show any genetic problem and, if there is one, \\nwill help demonstrate the pattern of inheritance.\\n6       If you have identiﬁ ed a familial susceptibility, or your patient has a recognized \\ngenetic disease, extend the family tree down to include children, to identify \\nothers who may be at risk and who may beneﬁ t from screening. \\ue007You should \\nﬁ nd out who is pregnant in the family, or may soon be, and arrange appropriate \\ngenetic counselling (OHCS p154).

Physical signs are elicited at the \\nbedside. T\\nogether, they constitute the features of the condition in that patient. \\nTheir evolution over time and interaction with the physical, psychological, and social \\nspheres comprise the natural history of any disease. Throughout this chapter, we \\ndiscuss symptoms in isolation and attempt to classify them into a ‘system’ or present \\nthem in the following \\nBOXES as ‘non-speciﬁ c’. This is unnatural but a good ﬁ rst step in \\nlearning how to diagnose. All doctors have to know about symptoms and their relief. \\nPart of becoming a good doctor is learning to link symptoms together, to identify \\nthose that may be normal, and those that are worrying. There are many online tools \\nand books that can help with this, but there is no substitute for experience. If you \\naren’t sure, ask a specialist in that area for advice.\\nThe following are common ‘non-speciﬁ c’ presentations.\\n_OHCM_10e.indb   28_OHCM_10e.indb   28 02/05/2017   19:0602/05/2017   19:06'),\n",

Even in the emergency department where \\nthe history may be brief, eg ‘trauma’, the examination is to conﬁ rm a fracture, or to \\ndecide that a fracture is less likely. The examination sheds further light on the his-\\ntory. As you get better, your physical examination gets briefer. Establish your own \\nroutine\\n—practice is the key.\\nEnd of the bed\\n  • Look at the patient —are they well or in extremis? What makes you think this? \\nAre they in pain? If so, does it make them lie still (eg peritonitis) or writhe about \\n(eg colic)? What is the pattern of breathing: laboured; rapid; shallow; irregular; \\ndistressed? Are they obese or cachectic? Is their behaviour appropriate? Can you \\ndetect any unusual smell, eg hepatic f\\n etor (p274), cigarettes, alcohol?\\n  • Also take a moment to look around the bed for other clues, eg inhalers, insulin \\nadministr\\nation kit, walking aids, etc.\\nFace and body habitus\\n  • Does the patient’s appearance suggest any particular diseases, eg acromegaly, thy-\\nr\\notoxicosis, myxoedema, Cushing’s syndrome, or hypopituitarism?

See speciﬁ c systems for features to assess \\nfor, but for all systems consider:\\nSkin colour:\\n  • Blue/purple = cyanosis (can also be central only, p34).\\n  • Yellow = jaundice (yellow skin can also be caused by uraemia, pernicious anaemia, \\ncarotenaemia—check the sclera: if they are also yellow it is jaundice).\\n  • Pallor: this is non-speciﬁ  c; anaemia is assessed from the palmar skin creases (when \\nspread) and conjunctivae (ﬁ g 8.3)—usually pale if Hb <80–90g/L: you cannot con-\\nclude anything from normal conjunctival colour, but if they are pale, the patient is \\nprobably anaemic.\\n  • Hyperpigmentation: Addison’s, haemo chr omatosis (slate-grey) and amiodarone, \\ngold, silver, and minocycline therapy.\\nCharts:\\n  • Temperature: varies during the day; a morning oral temperature >37.2°C or evening \\n>37.7°C constitutes a fever. 3 Rectal temperatures are generally 0.6°C above oral \\ntemperatures. Remember that temperatures are generally lower in elderly patients \\nand therefore fevers may not be as pronounced.\\n4 A core temperature <35°C indi-\\ncates hypothermia; special low-reading thermometers may be required.\\n  • Blood pressure and pulse—trends are more important than one-off  values; repeat \\nif concerned.\\n  • Urine: check urinalysis and input/output charts if available.\\nFluid status When admitting an unwell patient, don’t forget to assess their hydra-\\ntion, check skin tur\\ngor and mucous membranes, look for sunken eyes, and check \\ncapillary reﬁ ll (if well perfused <2s) and JVP.\\n_OHCM_10e.indb   32_OHCM_10e.indb   32 02/05/2017   19:0602/05/2017   19:06'),\n",

The cause \\nof oedema is still not completely understood.5\\nPeriorbital oedema: Oedema around the face has a very diff er ent diff  erential; the \\neyelid skin is very thin so periorbital oedema is usually the ﬁ  rst sign—think of al-\\nlergies (contact dermatitis, eg from eye make-up, stings), angioedema (can be \\nhereditary), infection ( \\ue007orbital cellulitis can be life-threatening, refer to hospital \\nimmediat\\nely if concerned, other infections include EBV and sinusitis); if there is prop-\\ntosis (p219) think Graves’ disease, connective tissue diseases (eg dermatomyositis, \\nSLE, sarcoid, amyloid); and many others. Assess for systemic disease before putting \\nit down to allergies.\\nNon-pitting oedema: Ie non-indentable, is lymphoedema due to poor lymphatic \\ndr\\nainage. Can be due to radiotherapy, malignant inﬁ ltration, infection, ﬁ lariasis, or \\nrarely primary lymphoedema (Milroy’s syndrome p706).\\nWeight loss\\nWeight loss can be both a symptom (ie reported by the patient) and a sign (identiﬁ ed \\nb\\ny physician). A feature of chronic disease, depression, malnutrition, malignancy, \\nchronic infections (eg TB, HIV/enteropathic AIDS), diabetes mellitus, and h yperthy-\\nroidism (typically in the presence of increased appetite). Severe generalized \\nmuscle wasting is also seen as part of a number of degenerative neurological \\ndiseases and in cardiac failure (cardiac cachexia), although in the latter, right \\nheart failure may not make weight loss a major complaint. Do not forget ano-\\nrexia nervosa (\\nOHCS p382) as an underlying cause of weight loss.\\nRule out treatable causes, eg diabetes is easy to diagnose—TB can be very hard. For \\nexample, the CXR may look like cancer so don’t forget to send bronchoscopy samples \\nfor ZN stain and TB culture. Unintentional weight loss should always ring alarm bells, \\nso assess patients carefully.\\nCachexia\\nGeneral muscle wasting from f amine, or \\ue001eating (dementia; stroke; MND, p506; ano-\\nrexia nervosa), malabsorption  (entero pathic AIDS/slim disease/Crypto spor idium; \\nWhipple’s) or \\ue000catabolism (neoplasia; CCF; TB; chronic kidney disease; \\ue000leptin).6\\n_OHCM_10e.indb   35_OHCM_10e.indb   35 02/05/2017   19:0602/05/2017   19:06'),\n",

Getting cuff   size right is vital. \\n\\ue007Optimal cuff width is 40% of the arm circumference. If you suspect a BP read-\\ning to be anomalous, check the equipment and review the observation chart for \\nprevious readings and other vital signs. Consider taking a manual reading with a \\ndiff erent set yourself.\\nOften a quiet chat will bring the \\nBP down (yours and your patient’s: keep your \\nears open, and the patient may reveal some new tangential but vital fact that the \\noffi  cial history glossed over). Many things aff  ect \\nBP readings from background \\nnoise to how much you touch the patient. If \\ue000BP, eg \\ue006150/90, check both arms.

Good lighting and \\ncorrect positioning are key. \\nLook for the right internal \\njugular vein as it passes just medial to the clavicular head of the sterno cleidomastoid \\nup behind the angle of the jaw to the earlobes. The JVP is assessed by measuring the \\nvertical height from the manubriosternal angle (not the sternal notch) to the top of \\nthe pulse. Pressure at zero (at the sternal angle) is 5cm, so add the height of the JVP \\nwith 5cm to obtain the right heart ﬁ  lling pressure in cm of water. A pressure above \\n9cm (4cm above the sternal angle at 45°) is elevated.\\nIs the pulse venous (and not arterial)?\\n  • Usually impalpable, and obliterated by ﬁ nger pressure on the vessel.\\n  • Rises transiently with pressure on abdomen (abdominojugular r eﬂ ux)2 or on liver \\n(hepatojug ular reﬂ ux), and alters with posture and respiration (disappears when \\npatient sits from lying ﬂ at).\\n  • Usually has a double pulse for every arterial pulse.

While listening, palpate the carotid \\nart\\nery: S1 is synchronous with the upstroke.\\nHeart sounds See ﬁ g 2.13. The 1st and 2nd sounds are usually clear. Conﬁ dent pro-\\nnouncements about other sounds and soft murmurs may be diffi  cult. Even senior \\ncolleagues disagree with one another about the more diffi   cult sounds and murmurs.\\nThe 1st heart sound (S1) Represents closure of mitral (M1) and tricuspid (T1) valves. \\nSplitting in inspiration may be heard and is normal.\\n  • L oud S 1 In mitral stenosis, because the narrowed valve oriﬁ ce limits ventricular \\nﬁ lling, there is no gradual decrease in ﬂ ow towards the end of diastole. The valves \\nare, therefore, at their maximum excursion at the end of diastole, and so shut rap-\\nidly leading to a loud S\\n1 (the ‘tapping’ apex). S1 is also loud if diastolic ﬁ lling time is \\nshortened, eg if the PR interval is short, and in tachycardia.\\n  • So ft S 1 occurs if the diastolic ﬁ lling time is prolonged, eg prolonged PR interval, or if \\nthe mitral valve leaﬂ ets fail to close properly (ie mitral incompetence).\\nThe intensity of S1 is variable in AV block, AF, and nodal or ventricular tachycardia.\\nThe 2nd heart sound (S2) Represents aortic (A2) and pulmonary valve (P2) closure. \\nThe most important abnormality of A2 is softening in aortic stenosis.\\n  • A2 is said to be loud in tachycardia, hypertension, and transposition, but this is \\nprobably not a useful clinical entity.\\n  • P2 is loud in pulmonary hypertension and soft in pulmonary stenosis.\\n  • Splitting o f S 2 in inspiration is normal and is mainly due to the variation of right \\nheart v\\nenous return with respiration, delaying the pulmonary component.\\n  • Wide splitting occurs in right bundle branch block ( BBB), pulmonary stenosis, \\ndeep inspiration, mitral regurgitation, and VSD.\\n  • Wide ﬁ xed splitting  occurs in atrial septal defect (ASD).\\n  • Reversed splitting (ie A 2 following P2, with splitting increasing on expiration) \\noccurs in left bundle branch block, aortic stenosis, PDA (patent ductus arterio-\\nsus), and right ventricular pacing.\\n  • A single S 2 occurs in Fallot’s tetralogy, severe aortic or pulmonary stenosis, \\npulmonary atresia, Eisenmenger’s syndrome (p156), large VSD, or hypertension.\\nNB: splitting and P2 are heard best in the pulmonary area.\\nAdditional sounds\\n3rd heart sound (S3) may occur just after S2. It is low pitched and best heard with the \\nbell of the stethoscope. S3 is pathological over the age of 30yrs. A loud S3 occurs in a \\ndilated left ventricle with rapid ventricular ﬁ  lling (mitral regurgitation, VSD) or poor LV \\nfunction (post MI, dilated cardiomyopathy). In constrictive pericarditis or restrictive \\ncardiomyopathy it occurs early and is more high pitched (‘pericardial knock’).\\n4th heart sound (S 4) occurs just before S 1. Always abnormal, it represents atrial \\ncontraction against a ventricle made stiff   by any cause, eg aortic stenosis or hyper-\\ntensive heart disease.\\nTriple and gallop rhythms A \\n3rd or 4th heart sound occurring with a sinus tachycar-\\ndia may give the impression of galloping hooves. An S3 gallop has the same rhythm \\nas ‘Ken-tucky’, whereas an S4 gallop has the same rhythm as ‘Tenne-ssee’. When S3 \\nand S4 occur in a tachycardia, eg with pulmonary embolism, they may summate and \\nappear as a single sound, a summation gallop.\\nAn ejection systolic click is heard early in systole with bicuspid aortic valves, and if \\n\\ue000BP. The right heart equivalent lesions may also cause clicks.\\nMid-systolic clicks occur in mitral valve prolapse (p144).\\nAn opening snap precedes the mid-diastolic murmur of mitral (and tricuspid) steno-\\nsis. It indicat\\nes a pliable (non-calciﬁ ed) valve.\\nProsthetic sounds are caused by non-biological valves, on opening and closing: rum-\\nbling sounds  ≈ b\\nall and cage valves (eg Starr–Edwards); single clicks ≈ tilting disc \\nvalve (eg single disc: Bjork Shiley; bileaﬂ et: St Jude—often quieter). Prosthetic mitral \\nvalve clicks occur in time with S1, aortic valve clicks in time with S2.\\n_OHCM_10e.indb   44_OHCM_10e.indb   44 02/05/2017   19:0602/05/2017   19:06'),\n",

The diaphragm ﬁ lters out \\nlow pitches, making higher-pitched murmurs easier to detect (eg aortic regurgita-\\ntion). \\nNB: a bell applied tightly to the skin becomes a diaphragm.\\n\\ue007Consider any murmur in terms of char acter, timing, loudness, area where loudest, \\nradiation, and accentuating manoeuvres.\\n\\ue007When in doubt, rely on echocardiography rather than disputed sounds. (But still \\nenjo\\ny trying to ﬁ  gure out the clinical conundrum!)\\nCharacter and timing (See ﬁ g 2.14.)\\n  • An ejection-s ystolic murmur ( ESM, crescendo –decrescendo) usually originates \\nfrom the outﬂ ow tract and waxes and wanes with the intraventricular pressures. \\nESMS may be innocent and are common in children and high-output states (eg \\ntachycardia, pregnancy). Organic causes include aortic stenosis and sclerosis, pul-\\nmonary stenosis, and \\nH(O)CM.\\n  • A pans ystolic murmur ( PSM) is of uniform intensity and merges with S2. It is usu-\\nally organic and occurs in mitral or tricuspid regurgitation (S1 may also be soft in \\nthese), or a ventricular septal defect (p156). Mitral valve prolapse may produce a \\nlate systolic murmur ± midsystolic click.\\n  • E arly diastolic murmurs ( EDMs) are high pitched and easily missed: listen for the \\n‘absence o\\nf silence’ in early diastole. An EDM occurs in aortic and, though rare, pul-\\nmonary regurgitation. If the pulmonary regurgitation is secondary to pulmonary \\nhypertension resulting from mitral stenosis, then the \\nEDM is called a Graham Steell \\nmurmur.\\n  • Mid-dias tolic murmurs ( MDMs) are low pitched and rumbling. They occur in mitral \\nst\\nenosis (accentuated presystolically if heart still in sinus rhythm), rheumatic fever \\n(Carey Coombs’ murmur: due to thickening of the mitral valve leaﬂ ets), and aortic \\nregurgitation (Austin Flint murmur: due to the ﬂ  uttering of the anterior mitral \\nvalve cusp caused by the regurgitant stream).\\nIntensity All murmurs are graded on a scale of 1–6 (see table 2.4), though in practice \\ndiastolic murmurs, being less loud, are only graded 1–4. Intensity is a poor guide to \\nthe severity of a lesion—an ESM may be inaudible in severe aortic stenosis.\\nArea where loudest Though an unreliable sign, mitral murmurs tend to be loudest \\no\\nver the apex, in contrast to the area of greatest intensity from lesions of the aortic \\n(right 2nd intercostal space), pulmonary (left 2nd intercostal space), and tricuspid \\n(lower left sternal edge) valves.\\nRadiation The ESM of aortic stenosis classically radiates to the carotids, in contrast \\nto the PSM of mitral regurgitation, which radiates to the axilla.\\nAccentuating manoeuvres\\n  • Mo\\nvements that bring the relevant part of the heart closer to the stethoscope ac-\\ncentuat\\ne murmurs (eg leaning forward for aortic regurgitation, left lateral position \\nfor mitral stenosis).\\n  • E xpiration increases blood ﬂ  ow to the left side of the heart and therefore accentu-\\nates left-sided murmurs. Inspiration has the opposite eff ect.\\n  • V alsalva manoeuvre (forced expiration against a closed glottis) decreases sys-\\nt\\nemic venous return, accentuating mitral valve prolapse and H(O)CM, but softening \\nmitral regurgitation and aortic stenosis. Squatting has e xactly the opposite eff  ect. \\nExercise accentuat es the murmur of mitral stenosis.\\nNon-valvular murmurs A pericar dial friction rub may be heard in pericarditis. \\nIt is a superﬁ  \\ncial scratching sound, not conﬁ ned to systole or diastole. Continuous \\nmurmurs are present throughout the cardiac cycle and may occur with a patent \\nductus art\\neriosus, arteriovenous ﬁ stula, or ruptured sinus of Valsalva.\\n_OHCM_10e.indb   46_OHCM_10e.indb   46 02/05/2017   19:0602/05/2017   19:06'),\n",

The sweets and drinks used \\nby the Famous Five actually contribute to the distension itself: fat, fluid, faeces, \\nflatus, and fetus. If you think it far-fetched to implicate ginger beer in the genesis \\no\\nf fetuses, note that because it was homemade, like the fun, there was no limit to \\nits intoxicating powers in those long-gone vintage summers. The point is to think to \\nask ‘When was your last period?’ whenever confronted by a distended abdomen.\\nFlatus will be resonant on percussion. Fluid will be dull, and can be from ascites (eg \\nfrom malignancy or cirrhosis: look for shifting dullness), distended bladder (cannot \\nget below it) or an aortic aneurysm (expansile). Masses can be pelvic (think of uter-\\nine ﬁ broids or ovarian pathology) or tumours from colon, stomach, pancreas, liver, or \\nkidney.

Do your best to help, and get social services involved \\nif concerned. Continence depends on man\\ny factors—mental function, stool (volume \\nand consistency), anatomy (sphincter function, rectal distensibility, anorectal sensa-\\ntion and reﬂ  exes). Defects in any area can cause loss of faecal continence.\\nCauses: Often multifactorial. Is it passive faecal soiling or urgency-related stool \\nloss\\n? Consider the following:\\n  • Sphinct er dysfunction:\\n  • Vaginal delivery is the commonest cause due to sphincter tears or pudendal \\nnerve damage.\\n  • Surgical trauma, eg following procedures for ﬁ stulas, haemorrhoids, ﬁ ssures.\\n  • Impair ed sensation —diabetes, MS, dementia, any spinal cord lesions ( \\ue022consider \\ncord compression if acute faecal incontinence).\\n  • F aecal impaction —overﬂ ow diarrhoea, extremely common, especially in the el-\\nderly, and very easily treated.\\n  • I diopathic —although there is often no clear cause found, especially in elderly \\nwomen, this is usually multifactorial, including a combination of poor sphincter \\ntone and pudendal damage leading to poor sensation.\\nAssessment:\\n\\ue007Do \\nPR (overﬂ ow incontinence? poor tone?) and assess neurological function of legs, \\nparticularly checking sensation.\\nRefer to a specialist (esp. if rectal prolapse, anal sphincter injury, lumbar disc disease, \\nor alarm symptoms for colon ca exist). Consider anorectal manometry, pelvic ultra-\\nsound or \\nMRI, and pudendal nerve testing may be needed.\\nTreat according to cause and to promote dignity:\\n\\ue007Never let your own embarrassment stop you from off \\n ering help. Knowledge and \\nbehaviour are key factors:\\n  • Ensure toilet is in easy reach. Plan trips in the knowledge of toilet locations.\\n  • Obey call-to-stool impulses (esp. after meal, ie the gastro-colic reﬂ ex).\\n  • Ensure access to latest continence aids and advice on use, refer to continence \\nnurse specialist f\\nor assessment.\\n  • Pelvic ﬂ oor r ehabilitation: eg can help faecal incontinence, squeeze pressure, and \\nmaximal tolerated volume.\\n  • Loperamide 2–4mg 45min before social engagements may prevent accidents out-\\nside home. An anal cotton plug may help isolated internal sphincter weakness. Skin \\ncare. Support agencies.\\nIf all sensible measures fail, try a brake-and-accelerator approach: enemas to empty \\nthe rectum (twice weekly) and codeine phosphate, eg \\n15mg/12h, on non-enema days \\nto constipate. It’s not a cure, but makes the incontinence manageable.\\nFlatulence\\nNormally, 400–1300mL of gas is expelled PR in 8–20 discrete (or indiscrete) episodes \\nper day. If this, with any eructation (belching) or distension, seems excessive to the \\npatient, they may complain of ﬂ atulence. Eructation occurs in hiatus hernia —but \\nmost patients with ‘ﬂ  atulence’ have no GI disease. Air swal lowing (aerophagy) is the \\nmain cause of ﬂ atus; here N2 is the chief gas. If ﬂ atus is mostly methane, H2 and CO2, \\nthen fermentation by bowel bacteria is the cause, and reducing carbohydrate intake \\n(eg less lactose and wheat) may help.\\n_OHCM_10e.indb   58_OHCM_10e.indb   58 02/05/2017   19:0602/05/2017   19:06'),\n",

It’s com-\\nmon in irritable bowel syndrome (p266), but can be caused by tumours.\\nRegurgitation\\nGastric and oesophageal contents are regurgitated eff  \\n ortlessly into the mouth —\\nwithout contraction of abdominal muscles and diaphragm (so distinguishing it from \\ntrue vomiting). It may be worse on lying ﬂ at, and can cause cough and nocturnal \\nasthma. Regurgitation is rarely preceded by nausea, and when due to gastro-oe-\\nsophageal reﬂ ux, it is often associated with heartburn. An oesophageal pouch may \\ncause regurgitation. Very high \\nGI obstructions (eg gastric volvulus, p611) cause non-\\nproductive retching rather than true regurgitation.\\nSteatorrhoea\\nThese are pale stools that are diffi  cult to ﬂ ush, and are caused by malabsorption of \\nfat in the small intestine and hence greater fat content in the stool.\\nCauses: Ileal disease (eg Crohn’s or ileal resection), pancreatic disease, and obstruc-\\ntiv\\ne jaundice (due to \\ue001excretion of bile salts from the gallbladder).\\nDyspepsia\\nDyspepsia and indigestion (p 252) are broad terms. Dyspepsia is deﬁ  ned as one or \\nmore of post-prandial fullness, early satiety (unable to ﬁ nish meal), and/or epigastric \\nor retrosternal pain or burning. ‘Indigestion’ reported by the patient can refer to \\ndyspepsia, bloating, nausea, and vomiting. Try to ﬁ  nd out exactly what your pa-\\ntient means and when these symptoms occur in relation to meals, eg the classic \\nsymptoms of peptic ulcers occur \\n2–5 hours after a meal and on an empty stomach. \\nLook for alarm symptoms (see p 248); these have high negative predictive value. \\nIf all patients with dyspepsia undergo endoscopy, <33% have clinically signiﬁ cant \\nﬁ ndings.11 Myocardial infaction may present as ‘indigestion’.\\nHalitosis\\nHalitosis (f etor oris, oral malodour) results from gingivitis (rarely severe enough to \\ncause Vincent’s angina, p712), metabolic activity of bacteria in plaque, or sulﬁ de-yield-\\ning food putrefaction, eg in gingival pockets and tonsillar crypts. Patients can often be \\nanxious and convinced of halitosis when it is not present (and vice versa!).\\nContributory factors:\\nSmoking, drugs (disulﬁ \\n ram; isosorbide), lung disease, hangovers.\\n\\ue057:\\nTry to eliminate anaerobes:\\n  • Good dental hygiene, dental ﬂ  \\n oss, tongue scraping.\\n  • 0.2% aqueous chlorhexidine gluconate.\\nThe very common halitosis arising from the tongue’s dorsum is secondary to over-\\npopulated volatile sulfur compound-producing bacteria. Locally retained bacteria \\nmetabolize sulfur-containing amino acids to yield volatile (\\ue018 smelly) hydrogen sulﬁ de \\nand methylmercaptane, which perpetuate periodontal disease. At night and be-\\ntween meals, conditions are optimal for odour production\\n—so eating regularly may \\nhelp. Treat by mechanical cleansing/scraping using tongue brushes or scrapes plus \\nmouthwashes. Oral care products containing metal ions, especially Zn, inhibit odour \\nformation, it is thought, because of affi  nity of the metal ion to sulfur. It is possible \\nto measure the level of volatile sulfur-containing compounds in the air in the mouth \\ndirectly by means of a portable sulﬁ de monitor._OHCM_10e.indb   59_OHCM_10e.indb   59 02/05/2017   19:0602/05/2017   19:06'),\n",

Leg cramps are com mon at night or aft er heavy exer-\\ncise, and in patients with renal impairment or on dialysis. Cramp can signify salt de-\\npletion, and rarely: muscle ischaemia (claudication, DM), myopathy (McArdle, p704), \\nor dystonia (writer’s cramp, p469). Forearm cramps suggest motor neuron disease. \\nNight cramps may respond to quinine bisulfate 300mg at night PO.\\nDrugs causing cramp: Diuretics (? from \\ue001K+), domperidone, salbutamol/terbutaline \\nIVI, ACE-i, telmisartan, celecoxib, lacidipine, ergot alkaloids, levothyroxine.\\nParaesthesiae\\n‘Pins and needles’, numbness/tingling, which can hurt or ‘burn’ (dysaes th esia).\\nCauses:\\nMe\\ntab olic, \\ue001Ca2+ (perioral); \\ue000PaCO2; myxoedema; neurotoxins (tick bite; sting). Vascular, \\n\\ue022arterial emboli; Raynaud’s; DVT; high plasma viscosity. Anti body-mediat ed, par aneo-\\nplastic; SLE; ITP. Infection, r are: Lyme; rabies. Drugs, ACE-i.

If wander-\\ning, tak e travel history, consider infection, eg strongyloides.\\nTremor\\nTremor is rh ythmic oscillation of limbs, trunk, head, or tongue. Three types:\\n1       R esting tremor —worst at rest—eg from parkinsonism (±bradykinesia and rigidity; \\ntremor is more resistant to treatment than other symptoms). It is usually a slow \\ntremor (frequency of 3–5Hz), typically ‘pill-rolling’ of the thumb over a ﬁ nger.\\n2       P ostural tremor —worst if arms are outstretched. Typically rapid (8–12Hz). May \\nbe exaggerated physiological tremor (eg anxiety, hyperthyroidism, alcohol, drugs), \\ndue to brain damage (eg Wilson’s disease, syphilis) or benign essential tremor  \\n(\\nBET). This is often familial (autosomal dominant) tremor of arms and head pre-\\nsenting at any age. Cogwheeling may occur but there is no brady kinesia. It is sup-\\npressed by alcohol, and patients may self-medicate rather than admit problems. \\nRarely progressive (unless onset is unilateral). Propranolol (\\n40–80mg/8–12h PO) can \\nhelp, but not in all patients.\\n3       Int ention tremor —worst on movement, seen in cerebellar disease, with past-\\npointing and dysdiadochokinesis (see p499). No eff  ective drug has been found.\\nFacial pain\\nCNS causes: Migraine, trigeminal, or glossopharyngeal neuralgia (p457) or from any \\nother pain-sensitive structure in the head or neck. Post-herpetic neuralgia: nasty \\nburning-and-stabbing pain involves dermatomal areas aff ected by shingles (p404); \\nit may aff ect cranial nerves V and VII in the face. It all too often becomes chronic \\nand intractable (skin aff ected is exquisitely sensitive). Treatment is hard. Always \\ngive strong psychological support. Transcutaneous nerve stimulation, capsaicin oint-\\nment, and inﬁ ltrating local anaesthetic are tried.

Think systematically. Is it in the brain-\\nstem (eg MS) or outside, pressing on the brainstem? \\nIs it the neuromuscular junction (myasthenia) or the \\nmuscles (eg a dystrophy)? Cranial nerves may be af-\\nfected singly or in groups. \\ue007Face the patient (helps \\nspo\\nt asymmetry). For causes of lesions see BOX ‘Caus-\\nes of cranial nerve lesions’.\\n  • I: Smell—test ability of each nostril (separately) to \\ndistinguish familiar smells, eg coff ee.\\n  • II: Acuity—test each eye separately, and its correct-\\nability with glasses or pin-hole; use Snellen chart, or \\nthe one inside the cover of this book. Visual ﬁ elds\\n— \\ncompare with your own ﬁ elds or formally via perim-\\netry testing. Any losses/inattention? Sites of lesions: \\nOHCS p428. Pupils (p72)—size, shape, symmetry, reac-\\ntion to light (direct and consensual) or accommoda-\\ntion. Swinging light test for relative aff erent pupillary \\ndefect. Ophthalmoscopy (\\nOHCS, p414)—best learnt from an ophthalmologist and dilat-\\ning drops help! Darken the room, warn the patient you will need to get close to their \\nface. Focus the lens on the optic disc (pale? swollen?). Follow vessels outwards to view \\neach quadrant. If the view is obscured, examine the red reﬂ  ex, with your focus on the \\nmargin of the pupil, to look for a cataract. Try to get a view of the fovea by asking the \\npatient to look directly at the ophthalmoscope \\ue007Pathology here needs prompt oph-\\nthalmic r\\neview. If in doubt, ask for slit lamp examination or photography of the retina.\\n  • III p, IV, & VI —eye movements. Ask the patient to keep their head still and follow \\nyour ﬁ  nger as you trace an imaginary ‘H’. IIIrd nerve palsy —ptosis, large pupil, \\neye down and out. IVth nerve palsy —diplopia on looking down and in (often no-\\nticed on descending stairs)—head tilting compensates for this (ocular torticollis). \\nVIth nerve palsy —horizontal diplopia on looking out. Nystagmus is involuntary, \\no\\nften jerky, eye oscillations. Horizontal nystagmus is often due to a vestibular le-\\nsion (acute: nystagmus away from lesion; chronic: towards lesion), or cerebellar \\nlesion (unilateral lesions cause nystagmus towards the aff ected side). If it is more \\nin whichever eye is abducting, \\nMS may be the cause (internuclear ophthalmoplegia, \\nsee ﬁ g 2.34). If also deafness/tinnitus, suspect a peripheral cause (eg VIIIth nerve \\nlesion, barotrauma, Ménière’s, p462). If it varies with head position, suspect benign \\npositional vertigo (p462). If it is up-and-down, ask a neurologist to review—upbeat \\nnystagmus classically occurs with lesions in the midbrain or at the base of the 4th \\nventricle, downbeat nystagmus in foramen magnum lesions. Nystagmus lasting ≤2 \\nbeats is normal, as is nystagmus at the extremes of gaze.\\n  • V: Motor palsy—‘Open your mouth’; jaw deviates to side of lesion, muscles of mas-\\ntication (temporalis, masseter and pterygoids). Sensory—check all three divisions. \\nConsider corneal reﬂ ex (lost ﬁ rst).\\n  • VII: p Facial nerve lesions cause dr oop and weakness. As the forehead has bilateral \\nrepresentation in the brain, only the lower two-thirds is aff ected in UMN lesions, but \\nall of one side of the face in LMN lesions. Ask to ‘raise your eyebrows’, ‘show me your \\nteeth’, ‘puff  out your cheeks’. Test taste with salt/sweet solutions (supplies anterior \\ntwo-thirds of tongue).\\n  • VIII: Hearing—p464. Ask to repeat a number whispered in an ear while you block \\nthe other. Perform Weber’s and Rinne’s tests (p464). Balance/vertigo —p462.\\n  • IX p & X: p Gag reﬂ ex—ask the patient to say ‘Ah’. Xth nerve lesions also cause the pal-\\nate to be pulled to the normal side on saying ‘Ah’, uvula deviates away. Ask them to \\nswallow a sip of water. Consider gag reﬂ ex—touch the back of the soft palate with \\nan orange stick. The aff erent arm of the reﬂ ex involves IX; the eff  erent arm involves X.\\n  • XI: Trapezii—‘Shrug your shoulders’ against resistance. Sternocleidomastoid : \\n‘T\\nurn your head to the left/right’ against resistance.\\n  • XII: Tongue movement—the tongue deviates to the side of the lesion.\\nI olfactory\\nII optic\\nIII oculomotor\\nIV trochlear\\nV1 ophthalmic division\\nV2 maxillary division\\nV3 mandibular division\\nVI abducens\\nVII facial\\nVIII vestibulo  cochlear\\nIX glossopharyngeal\\nX vagus\\nXI accessory\\nXII hypoglossal\\nCranial nerve names\\n_OHCM_10e.indb   70_OHCM_10e.indb   70 02/05/2017   19:0602/05/2017   19:06'),\n",

Action potentials go \\nalong optic nerve (red), traversing optic \\nchiasm, passing synapses at pre-tectal nu-\\ncleus, en route to Edinger–Westphal nuclei \\nof CNIII. These send ﬁ  bres to both irises’ \\nciliary muscles (so both pupils constrict) \\nvia ciliary ganglion  (also relays accom-\\nmodation and corneal sensation, and gets \\nsympathetic roots from C 8–T2, carrying \\nﬁ bres to dilate pupil).\\nCranial nerve lesions of the eye\\nPupillary abnormalities\\nKey questions: • Equal, central, circular, dilated, or constricted? • React to light, \\ndirectly and consensually? • Constrict normally on convergence/accommodation?\\nIrregular pupils:  Anterior uveitis (iritis), trauma to the eye, syphilis.\\nDilated pupils:  CN III lesions (\\ue007inc. \\ue000ICP, p830) and mydriatic drugs. Always ask: is \\nthis pupil dilated, or is it the other that is constricted?\\nConstricted pupils: Old age, sympathetic nerve damage (Horner’s, p702, and ptosis, \\np73), opiates, miotics (pilocarpine drops for glaucoma), pontine damage.\\nUnequal pupils (anisocoria):  May be due to unilateral lesion, eye-drops, eye surgery, \\nsyphilis, or Holmes–Adie pupil. Some inequality is normal.\\nLight reaction: Test: cover one eye and shine light into the other obliquely. Both \\npupils should constrict, one by direct, other by consensual light reﬂ ex (ﬁ g 2.33). The \\nlesion site is deduced by knowing the pathway: from the retina the message passes \\nup the optic nerve (CNII) to the superior colliculus (midbrain) and thence to the CNIII \\nnuclei on both sides. The IIIrd cranial nerve causes pupillary constriction. If a light in \\none eye causes only contralateral constriction, the defect is ‘eff erent’, as the aff erent \\npathways from the retina being stimulated must be intact. Test for relative afferent \\npupillary defect:  move torch quickly from pupil to pupil. If there has been incomplete \\ndamage to the aff erent pathway, the aff ected pupil will paradoxically dilate when \\nlight is moved from the normal eye to the abnormal eye. This is because, in the face \\nof reduced aff  erent input from the aff  ected eye, the consensual pupillary relaxation \\nresponse from the normal eye predominates. This is the Marcus Gunn sign, and may \\noccur after apparent complete recovery from the initial lesion.\\nReaction to accommodation/convergence: If the patient ﬁ  rst looks at a distant \\nobject and then at the examiner’s ﬁ nger held a few inches away, the eyes will con-\\nverge and the pupils constrict. Aff erent ﬁ bres in each optic nerve pass to the lateral \\ngeniculate bodies. Impulses then pass to the pre-tectal nucleus and then to the para-\\nsympathetic nuclei of the IIIrd cranial nerves, causing pupillary constriction.\\n  • Holmes–Adie (myotonic) pupil: The aff ected pupil is normally moderately dilated \\nand is poorly reactive to light, if at all. It is slowly reactive to accommodation; wait \\nand watch carefully: it may eventually constrict more than a normal pupil. It is often \\nassociated with diminished or absent ankle and knee reﬂ exes, in which case the \\nHolmes–Adie syndrome is present. Usually a benign incidental ﬁ  nding. Rare causes: \\nLyme disease, syphilis, parvovirus B19, HSV, autoimmunity. \\ue033>\\ue032.\\n  • Argyll Robertson pupil:  This occurs in neurosyphilis. The pupil is constricted and \\nunreactive to light, but reacts to accommodation. Other possible causes: Lyme \\ndisease; HIV; zoster; diabetes mellitus; sarcoidosis; MS; paraneoplastic; \\ue001B12. The \\niris may be patchily atrophied, irregular, and depigmented. The lesion site is not \\nalways near the Edinger–Westphal nucleus or even in the midbrain. Pseudo-Argyll \\nRobertson pupils occur in Parinaud’s syndrome (p708).\\n  • Hutchinson pupil: This is the sequence of events resulting from rapidly rising uni-\\nlateral intracranial pressure (eg in intracerebral haemorrhage). The pupil on the \\nside of the lesion ﬁ rst constricts then widely dilates. The other pupil then goes \\nthrough the same sequence. \\ue007See p830.\\n_OHCM_10e.indb   72_OHCM_10e.indb   72 02/05/2017   19:0602/05/2017   19:06'),\n",

The nails and \\nskin can inform about systemic disease:\\nNail abnormalities\\n  • Koilonychia (spoon-shaped nails, ﬁ g 2.40) suggests \\niron deﬁ ciency, haemochromatosis, infection (eg \\nfungal), endocrine disorders (eg acromegaly, hypo-\\nthyroidism), or malnutrition.\\n  • Onycholysis (detachment of the nail from the nail-\\nbed) is seen with hyper thyroidism, fungal infection, \\nand psoriasis.\\n  • Beau’s lines (ﬁ g 2.41) are transverse furrows from \\ntemporary arrest of nail growth at times of biologi-\\ncal stress: severe infection. Nails grow at ~0.1mm/d, \\nthe furrow’s distance from the cuticle allows dating \\nof the stress.\\n  • Mees’ lines are single white transverse bands clas-\\nsically seen in arsenic poisoning, chronic kidney dis-\\nease, and carbon monoxide poisoning among others.\\n  • Muehrcke’s lines  are paired white parallel trans-\\nverse bands (without furrowing of the nail itself, \\ndistinguishing them from Beau’s lines) seen, eg, in \\nchronic hypoalbuminaemia, Hodgkin’s disease, pel-\\nlagra (p268), chronic kidney disease.\\n  • Terry’s nails : Proximal portion of nail is white/\\npink, nail tip is red/brown (causes include cirrhosis, \\nchronic kidney disease, congestive cardiac failure).\\n  • Pitting is seen in psoriasis and alopecia areata.\\n  • Splinter haemorrhages (ﬁ g 2.42) are ﬁ ne longitudi-\\nnal haemorrhagic streaks (under the nails), which in \\nthe febrile patient may suggest infective endocardi-\\ntis. They may be microemboli, or be normal—eg due \\nto gardening.\\n  • Nail-fold infarcts:  Embolic, typically seen in vascu-\\nlitic disorders (OHCS, p452).\\n  • Nail clubbing  See p77.\\n  • Chronic paronychia  is a chronic infection of the \\nnail-fold and presents as a painful swollen nail with \\nintermittent discharge (ﬁ g 2.43).\\nSkin changes\\n  • Palmar erythema (ﬁ g 2.44) is associated with cir-\\nrhosis, pregnancy, hyperthyroidism, rheumatoid \\narthritis, polycythaemia; also chronic liver disease—\\nvia \\ue001inactivation of vasoactive endotoxins by the \\nliver.

Be sure to inspect the pressure points, ie between the \\ntoes and under the heel.\\n2       P alpation: Skin temperature will be cool in peripheral arterial disease. Is there \\na le\\nvel above which it is warm? Delayed capillary reﬁ ll (>2s) also indicates arte-\\nrial disease. Are peripheral pulses palpable or not? ‘If you cannot count it, you \\nare not feeling it.’ Note down on a quick stick-man diagram where they become \\npalpable. Check for atrial ﬁ brillation or other arrhythmias, as these can be the \\ncause of embolic disease. Palpate for an enlarged abdominal aorta and attempt \\nto assess size. (Though don’t press too ﬁ  rmly!) \\n\\ue022An expansile pulsatile mass \\nin the presence of abdominal symptoms is a ruptured aneurysm until proven \\notherwise.\\n3       Auscult\\nation: The presence of bruits suggests arterial disease.

Ulcers around the medial malleolus are more suggestive of venous \\ndisease, whereas those at the pressure points suggest arterial pathology. Brown \\nhaemosiderin deposits result from venous hypertension. There may also be atro-\\nphy and loss of skin elasticity (lipodermatosclerosis) in venous disease.\\n2       P\\nalpation: Warm varicose veins may indicate infection. Are they tender? Firm, \\nt\\nender varicosities suggests thrombosis. Palpate the saphenofemoral junction \\n(SF J) for a saphena varix which displays a cough impulse. Similarly, incompetence \\nat the saphenopopliteal junction (SP J) may be felt as a cough impulse. If ulcera-\\ntion is present, it is prudent to palpate the arterial pulses to rule out arterial \\ndisease.\\n3       T\\nap test: A transmitted percussion impulse from the lower limit of the varicose \\nv\\nein to the saphenofemoral junction demonstrates incompetence of superﬁ cial \\nvalves.\\n4       Auscult ation: Bruits over the varicosities means there is an arteriovenous mal-\\nf\\normation.\\n5       Doppler: Test for the level of reﬂ ux.

Anuria is deﬁ ned as \\n<50mL/24h. In a catheterized patient with sudden anuria consider catheter blockage, \\nwith slow decline of oliguria to anuria renal dysfunction is more likely.\\nPolyuria\\nIncreased urine volume, eg >3L/24h. Causes: Over-enthusiastic IV ﬂ uid therapy; diabe-\\ntes mellitus & insipidus (diabetes is Greek for fountain);\\ue000Ca2+; psycho genic polydipsia/\\nPIP syndrome (p240); polyuric phase of recovering acute tubular necrosis.\\nIrritative or obstructive bladder symptoms\\n(See also p642.) Symptoms of prostate enlargement are miscalled ‘prost atism’; it is \\nbetter to talk about irritative or obstructive bladder  symptoms, as bladder neck \\nobstruction or a stricture may be the cause.\\n1       Irrit ative bladder symptoms: Urgency, dysuria, frequency, nocturia 6 (the last \\ntwo are also associated with causes of polyuria).\\n2       Obs tructive symptoms:  Reduced size and force of urinary stream, hesitancy and \\nint\\nerruption of stream during voiding and terminal dribbling—the usual cause is \\nenlargement of the prostate (prostatic hyperplasia), but other causes include \\na urethral stricture, tumour, urethral valves, or bladder neck contracture. The \\nmaximum ﬂ  ow rate of urine is normally ~\\n18–30mL/s.\\nTerminal dribbling\\nDribbling at the end of urination, often seen in conjunction with incontinence follow-\\ning incomplet\\ne urination, associated with prostatism.\\nUrinary changes\\nCloudy urine suggests pus (UTI) but is often normal phosphate precipitation in an \\nalkaline urine. Pneumaturia (bubbles in urine as it is passed). Occurs with UTI due to \\ngas-forming organisms or may signal an enterovesical (bowel–bladder) ﬁ stula from \\ndiverticulitis, Crohn’s disease or neoplastic disease of the bowel. Nocturia occurs \\nwith ‘irritative bladder’, diabetes mellitus, UTI, and reversed diurnal rhythm (seen in \\nrenal and cardiac failure). Haematuria (RBC in urine) is due to neoplasia or glomeru-\\nlonephritis (p310) until proven otherwise. Rule out UTI.\\nVoiding diffi  cult y\\nThis includes poor ﬂ  ow, straining to void, hesitancy, intermittent stream, incontinence \\n(eg overﬂ ow), retention (acute or chronic), incomplete emptying (±UTI from residual \\nurine). \\ue007Remember faecal impaction as a cause of retention with overﬂ ow. Causes: \\nObstructive:  prostatic hyperplasia, early oedema after bladder neck repair, uterine \\nprolapse, retroverted gravid uterus, ﬁ broids, ovarian cysts, urethral foreign body, \\nectopic ureterocele, bladder polyp, or cancer. Bladder overdistension—eg after epi-\\ndural for childbirth. Detrusor weakness or myopathy causes incomplete emptying \\n+ dribbling overﬂ  ow incontinence (do cystometry/electro myography; causes include \\nneurological disease and interstitial cystitis (OHCS p306); it may lead to a contr acted \\nbladder, eg requiring substitution enterocystoplasty). Drugs: epidural anaesthesia; \\ntricyclics, anticholinergics.

See also lumps in the neck, p598–\\n600.\\n1       Inspection The key questions to ask oneself when presented with a lump in the \\nneck ar\\ne: Is this lump thyroid related or not? What is the patient’s thyroid sta-\\ntus? Inspect the neck; the normal thyroid is usually neither visible nor palpable. A \\nmidline swelling should raise your suspicion of thyroid pathology. Look for scars \\n(eg collar incision from previous thyroid surgery). Examine the face for signs \\nof hypothyroidism (puffi   ness, pallor, dry ﬂ  aky skin, xanthelasma, corneal arcus, \\nbalding, loss of lateral third of eyebrow) as well as overall body habitus. Assess \\nthe patient’s demeanour; do they appear anxious, nervous, agitated, ﬁ dgety (hy-\\nperthyroid)? Or slow and lethargic (hypothyroid)?\\n2       S\\nwallow test Only goitres (p 600), thyroglossal cysts (p598) and in some cases \\nlymph nodes should move up on swallowing.\\n3       T ongue protrusion test A thyroglossal cyst will move up on tongue protrusion.\\n4       P alpation (By this stage of the examination if the evidence is in favour of the \\nlump no\\nt rising from the thyroid it is acceptable to examine the lump like any oth-\\ner (p594); assess site, size, shape, smoothness (consistency), surface (contour/\\nedge/\\ncolour), and surroundings, as well as transilluminance, ﬁ x ation/tether ing, \\nﬂ uctuance/compressibility, temperature, tenderness and whether it is pulsatile.) \\nIf a thyroid mass is suspected, standing behind the patient provides an oppor-\\ntunity to check for any proptosis (hyperthyroidism). Proceed to palpate each \\nlobe, attempting to decide whether any lump is solitary or multiple , nodular \\nor smooth/diffuse as well as site, size, etc. Repeating the swallow test while \\npalpating allows you to conﬁ rm the early ﬁ nding, but also attempt to ‘get below \\nthe lump’. If there is a distinct inferior border under which you can place your \\nhand with the entire lump above it then the goitre is unlikely to have retrosternal \\nextension. Examining for ‘spread’ to the lymph nodes is particularly important \\nif y\\nou suspect a thyroid malignancy (p600). Complete palpation by assessing if \\nthe presence of the lump has caused the trachea to deviate from the midline.\\n5       P ercussion A retrosternal goitre will produce a dull percussion note when the \\nst\\nernum is percussed.\\n6       Ausculta tion A bruit in a smooth thyroid goitre is suggestive of Graves’ disease \\n(p218).\\nThe next stages of the exam are to examine the systemic signs of thyroid status.\\n7       Hands Clubbing (‘thyroid acropachy’) is seen in Graves’ disease. Palmar erythe-\\nma and a ﬁ \\nne tremor are also signs of thyrotoxicosis. Assess temperature (warm \\nperipheries if hyperthyroid) and the radial pulse; tachycardia and atrial ﬁ brilla-\\ntion are seen in hyperthyroidism, while bradycardia is seen in hypothyroidism.\\n8       Eye s  The ‘normal’ upper eyelid should always cover the upper eye such that the \\nwhit\\ne sclera is not visible between the lid and the iris. In hyperthyroidism with \\nexophthalmus there is proptosis as well as lid retraction and ‘lid lag’ may also be \\ndetected. If the patient reports double vision when eye movements are being \\ntested this indicates ophthalmoplegia of hyperthyroidism.\\n9       Asking the patient to stand allows you to assess whether there is any proximal \\nm\\nyopathy (hypothyroidism). Look for pretibial myxoedema (brown swelling of \\nthe lower leg above the lateral malleoli in Graves’ disease). Finally, test the reﬂ ex-\\nes; these will be slow relaxing in hypothyroidism and brisk in hyperthyroidism.\\n10      Thank the patient and consider whether the lump is a goitre, and if so whether it \\nis single/\\nmultiple, diff use/nodular, as well as the patient’s thyroid status.

There is evidence that tool-naming is handled diff erently and in a diff erent \\narea to fruit-naming. There are also individual diff erences in the anatomy of these \\nmosaics. This is depressing for those who want a rigid classiﬁ cation of aphasia, \\nbut a source of hope to those who have had a stroke: recovery may be better than \\nneuroimaging leads us to believe.\\nProblems with classifying dysphasias\\nStart by reassuring the patient ‘I know this may be diffi  cult...’ and try to engage \\nin conversation; asking questions that need to phrase to answer (ie not just yes/\\nno). This tests ﬂ uency and reception, understanding, and allows assessment of \\narticulation, eg ‘How did you travel here today?’, ‘I came by bus’. Then assess \\ndysphasia by asking: ‘What is this’ eg pen (tests for nominal dysphasia), repeat \\n‘British Constitution’ (tests for conduction dysphasia and dysarthria). Then ask \\npatient to follow one-, two-, and three-step commands ensuring these ‘cross the \\nmidline’, eg make a ﬁ  st with your right hand then extend your right index ﬁ nger \\nand touch your left ear.\\nAssessing higher mental function: a practical guide\\nSymptoms of movement disorders\\nAthetosis is due to a lesion in the putamen, causing slow sinuous writhing move-\\nments in the hands, which ar\\ne present at rest.

One simple \\napproach can be to consider negative and positive symptoms. Negative symp-\\nt\\noms involve the absence of a behaviour, thought, feeling, or sensation (eg lack \\no\\nf appetite, apathy, and blunted emotions in depression), whereas positive symp-\\nt\\noms involve their presence when not normally expected (eg thought insertion, \\nie ‘Someone is putting thoughts int\\no my head’). Understanding the diff  erence \\nbetween psychosis and neurosis is vital. Psychosis entails a thought disorder (eg \\nthought insertion, thought br\\noadcasting) ± delusions (abnormal beliefs which are \\nheld to despite all reasoning, and which run counter to the patient’s cultural back-\\nground) and abnormal perceptions (eg hallucinations). Neurosis entails insight—if \\nthere are intrusive ideas or odd experiential phenomena, the person knows that \\nthey are false or illusory (and may be triggered by stress, etc.).\\nDisorders of thought include ﬂ \\night of ideas, in which the speech races through \\nthemes, s\\nwitching whimsically or through associations, eg ‘clang’ association: \\n‘Yesterday I went down to the local shop. I didn’t hop (clang), but I walked. Kan-\\ngaroos hop, don’t they? My friend Joey wasn’t there, though…’. Knight’s move  \\nis an une\\nxpected change in the direction of speech or conversation (akin to the \\nlateral component of the move of the knight’s piece in chess) and neologism is \\nthe f\\normation of new words. They may be normal or indicate an organic brain \\ncondition or a psychosis.\\nMany psychiatric symptoms in isolation, to a lesser degree of severity, or even in \\na diff  erent culture, may well be considered part of ‘normal’ behaviour. For exam-\\nple, a vision from a religious ﬁ  gure may be considered normal, whereas one from \\nan alien may not. Consider your patient in their cultural and religious context. \\nAs with so many aspects of medicine, in psychiatry there is a vast spectrum of \\nbehaviour, thought, and perception, at least one extreme of which is considered to \\nbe ‘abnormal’. It is in part our challenge to attempt to interpret these symptoms \\nwith relevance, insight, and impartiality so that we may best beneﬁ t our patients \\nand not form opinions that are set in stone. On acute medical wards psychiatric \\nsymptoms are often due to stress, drug or alcohol withdrawal, \\nU&E imbalance, or \\nmedication. When in doubt, ask a psychiatrist to help.\\n\\ue007Beware of simplistic formulations, eg I f you talk to God, you are praying. If \\nGod talks to you, you have schizophrenia (Dr Thomas Szasz). It is not the audi-\\ntory phenomenon that makes the diagnosis of psychosis: what matters is what the \\npatient believes about the phenomenon, and whether they are associated with a \\nthought disorder or a delusion.\\nPsychiatric symptoms\\n_OHCM_10e.indb   89_OHCM_10e.indb   89 02/05/2017   19:0602/05/2017   19:06'),\n",

A prolonged ( >½h), dull, \\ncentral crushing pain or pressure suggests MI.\\nRadiation: To shoulder, either or both arms, or neck/jaw suggests cardiac ischae-\\nmia. T\\nhe pain of aortic dissection (p 654) is classically instantaneous, tearing, and \\ninterscapular, but may be retrosternal. Epigastric pain may be cardiac.\\nPrecipitants: Pain associated with cold, exercise, palpitations, or emotion suggests \\ncar\\ndiac pain or anxiety; if brought on by food, lying ﬂ at, hot drinks, or alcohol, con-\\nsider oesophageal spasm/disease (but meals can also cause angina).\\nRelieving factors:  If pain is relieved within minutes by rest or glyceryl trinitrate \\n(GTN), suspect angina (GTN relieves oesophageal spasm more slowly). If antacids help, \\nsuspect GI causes. Pericarditic pain improves on leaning forward.\\nAssociations: Dyspnoea occurs with cardiac pain, pulmonary emboli, pleurisy, or \\nanxiet\\ny. MI may cause nausea, vomiting, or sweating. Angina is caused by coronary \\nartery disease —and also by aortic stenosis, hypertrophic cardiomy opathy (HCM), \\nparoxysmal supraventricular tachycardia (SVT)—and can be exacerbated by anae-\\nmia. Chest pain with tenderness suggests self-limiting Tietze’s syndrome. 1 Odd neu-\\nrological symptoms and atypical chest pain—think aortic dissection.\\nPleuritic pain: Pain exacerbated by inspiration. Implies inﬂ ammation of the pleura \\nfrom pulmonary infection, inﬂ ammation, or infarction.

Ask about shortness of breath at rest, \\non exertion, and on lying ﬂ at; has their exercise tolerance changed? Associations:  \\nSpeciﬁ \\nc symptoms associated with heart failure are orthopnoea (ask about number \\nof pillows used at night), paroxysmal nocturnal dyspnoea (waking up at night gasp-\\ning for breath, p49), and peripheral oedema. Pulmonary embolism is associated with \\nacute onset of dyspnoea and pleuritic chest pain; ask about risk factors for DVT.\\nPalpitation(s) May be due to ectopics, sinus tachycardia, AF, SVT, VT, thyrotoxicosis, \\nanxiety, and rarely phaeochromocytoma. See p 36. History: Characterize: do they \\nmean their heart w\\nas beating fast, hard, or irregularly? Ask about previous episodes, \\nprecipitating/relieving factors, duration of symptoms, associated chest pain, dysp-\\nnoea, dizziness, or collapse. Did the patient check their pulse?\\nSyncope May reﬂ  \\nect cardiac or CNS events. Vasovagal ‘faints’ are common (pulse\\ue001, \\npupils dilated). The history from an observer is invaluable in diagnosis.  Prodromal \\ns\\nymptoms: Chest pain, palpitations, or dyspnoea point to a cardiac cause, eg ar-\\nrh\\nythmia. Aura, headache, dysarthria, and limb weakness indicate CNS causes. \\nDuring the episode: Was there a pulse? Limb jerking, tongue biting, or urinary incon-\\ntinence\\n? NB: hypoxia from lack of cerebral perfusion may cause seizures. Recovery: \\nW\\nas this rapid (arrhythmia) or prolonged, with drowsiness (seizure)?\\n1 25% of non-cardiac chest pain is musculoskeletal:  look for pain on speciﬁ c postures or activity. Aim to \\nreproduce the pain by movement and, sometimes, palpation over the structure causing it.  Focal inj ection of \\nlocal anaesthetic helps diagnostically and is therapeutic.

The doctor goes on: ‘Sharp like a knife—or \\ndull and crushing?’ The doctor is getting irritated because the patient must know \\nthe answer but is not saying it. A true story paves the way to being less inquisito-\\nrial and having a more creative understanding of the nature of symptoms.\\nA patient came to a previous \\nOHCM author saying ‘Last night I dreamed I had a \\npain in my chest. Now I’ve woken up, and I’m not sure —have I got chest pain, \\ndoctor? What do you think?’ How odd it is to be asked to examine a patient to \\nexclude a symptom, not a disease. (It turned out that she did have serious chest \\npathology.) Odd, until one realizes that symptoms are often half-formed, and it \\nis our role to give them a local habitation and a name. Dialogue can transform a \\nsymptom from ‘airy nothingness’ to a fact. \\n2\\nPatients often avoid using the word ‘pain’ to describe ischaemia: ‘wind’, ‘tighten-\\ning’, ‘pressure’, ‘burning’, or ‘a lump in the throat’ (angina means to choke) may \\nbe used. They may say ‘sharp’ to communicate severity, and not character. So be \\nas vague in your questioning as your patient is in their answers. ‘Tell me some \\nmore about what you are feeling (long pause) … as if someone was doing what to \\nyou?’ ‘Sitting on me’ or ‘like a hotness’ might be the response (suggesting cardiac \\nischaemia). Do not ask ‘Does it go into your left arm’. Try ‘Is there anything else \\nabout it?’ (pause) … ‘Does it go anywhere?’ Note down your patient’s exact words.\\nA good history, taking account of these features, is the best way to stratify pa-\\ntients likely to have cardiac pain. If the history is non-speciﬁ  c, there are no risk fac-\\ntors for cardiovascular diseases, and \\nECG and plasma troponin T (p118) are normal \\n6–12h after the onset of pain, discharge will probably be OK. 4 When in doubt, get \\nhelp. Features making cardiac pain unlikely:\\n  • Stabbing, shooting pain.\\n  • Pain lasting <30s, however intense.\\n  • Well-localized, left sub-mammary pain (‘In my heart, doctor’).\\n  • Pains of continually varying location.\\n  • Youth.\\nDo no\\nt feel that you must diagnose every pain. Chest pain with no cause is com-\\nmon, even after extensive tests. Some patients have a ‘chronic pain syndrome’ \\nsimilar to post-herpetic neuralgia. Typically, this responds to a tricyclic, eg low-\\ndose amitriptyline at night (this dose does not imply any depression).\\nAvoid being that doctor who triumphantly tells a patient that they are ﬁ ne and \\ncan go home, only to be met by a glare, as the disabling pain the patient presented \\nwith is no better than when they arrived. Take time to explain why you do not \\nbelieve the pain is a result of dangerous pathology; to give advice on pain control \\nand ‘red ﬂ ags’; and to reassure the patient that their problem is likely to resolve \\nwith time.\\nChest pain from the patient’s perspective\\n2 Dialogue-transformed symptoms explain one of the junior doctor’s main vexations: when patients retell \\nsymptoms to a consultant in the light of day, they bear no resemblance to what you originally heard. But do \\nnot be vexed: your dialogue may have helped the patient far more than any ward round.\\n_OHCM_10e.indb   95_OHCM_10e.indb   95 02/05/2017   19:0602/05/2017   19:06'),\n",

Then (see ﬁ g 3.3):\\n  • Ra te:  At usual speed (25mm/s) each ‘big square’ is 0.2s; each ‘small square’ is 0.04s. \\nTo calculate the rate, divide 300 by the number of big squares between two con-\\nsecutive R waves (table 3.1). The normal rate is 60–100bpm.\\n  • Rh ythm: If cycles are not clearly regular, use the ‘card method’: lay a card along \\nthe ECG, marking positions of three successive R waves. Slide the card to and fro to \\ncheck that all intervals are equal. If they are not, note if:\\n  • there is slight but regular lengthening and then shortening (with respiration)—\\nsinus arrhythmia, common in the young\\n  • there are diff  erent rates which are multiples of each other—varying block\\n  • it is 100% irregular—atrial ﬁ brillation (AF) or ventricular ﬁ bril lation (VF).\\nSinus rhythm is characterized by a P wave followed by a QRS complex. AF has no dis-\\ncernible P waves and QRS complexes are irregularly irregular. Atrial ﬂ utter (p130, ﬁ g \\n3.35 p131) has a ‘sawtooth’ baseline of atrial depolarization (~300/min) and regular \\nQRS complexes. Ventricular rhythm has QRS complexes >0.12s with P waves follow-\\ning them or absent (ﬁ g 3.12, p106).\\n  • Axis: The overall direction of depolarization across the patient’s anterior chest; this \\nis the sum o\\nf all the ventricular electrical forces during ventricular depolarization. \\nSee BOX ‘Determining the ECG axis’. Left axis deviation can result from left anterior \\nhemiblock, inferior MI, VT from a left ventricular focus, WPW, LVH. Right axis devia-\\ntion can result from RVH, PE, anterolateral MI, WPW and left posterior hemiblock.\\n  • P wave: Normally precedes each QRS complex, and upright in II, III, & aVF but invert-\\ned in aVR. Absent P wave: AF, P hidden due to junctional or ventricular rhythm. P mi-\\ntrale: biﬁ d P wave, indicates left atrial hypertrophy. P pulmonale: peaked P wave, \\nindicates right atrial hyper trophy. Pseudo-P-pulmonale seen if \\ue000K+.\\n  • PR interval: Measure from start of P wave to start of QRS. Normal range: 0.12–0.2s \\n(3–5 small squares). A prolonged PR interval implies delayed AV conduction ( 1st \\ndegree heart block). A short PR interval implies unusually fast AV conduction down \\nan accessory pathway, eg WPW (see ﬁ g 3.37, p133). See heart block, p98.\\n  • QRS complex: See ﬁ g 3.2. Normal duration: <0.12s. QRS >0.12s suggests ventricular \\nconduction defects, eg a bundle branch block (pp99, 100), metabolic disturbance, or \\nventricular origin (eg ventricular ectopic). High-amplitude QRS complexes suggest \\nventricular hypertrophy (p100). Normal Q waves are <0.04s wide and <2mm deep; \\nthey are often seen in leads I , aVL , V5, and V6 and reﬂ  ect normal septal depolariza-\\ntion. Pathological Q waves (deep and wide) may occur within a few hours of an \\nacute MI.\\n  • QT interval: Measure from start of QRS to end of T wave. It varies with rate. The \\ncorrected QT interval (QTc) is the QT interval divided by the square root of the R–R \\ninterval, ie QTc=QT/√RR. Normal QTc: 0.38–0.42s. For causes of prolonged QT interval \\nsee p711. Long QT can lead to VT and sudden death.\\n  • ST segment: Usually isoelectric. Planar elevation (>1mm) or depression (>0.5mm) usu-\\nally implies infarction (p119, ﬁ gs 3.9, 3.10, pp103–4) or ischaemia, respectively.\\n  • T wave: Normally inverted in aVR, V1, and occasionally V2. Normal if inverted in isola-\\ntion in lead III. Abnormal if inverted in I, II, and V4–V6. Peaked in hyperkalaemia (ﬁ g \\n14.4, p675) and ﬂ attened in hypokalaemia.\\n  • J wave: See p849. The J point is where the S wave ﬁ nishes and ST segment starts. A \\nJ wave is a notch at this point. Seen in hypothermia, SAH, and \\ue000Ca2+.\\nFig 3.2 ‘ QRS’ complexes.

Normally, a wave of depolarization reaches the ventricles via the spe-\\ncialist conduction pathways—the bundles of His. This delivers the electrical activity \\nto certain points of the ventricles, meaning the waves of depolarization need travel \\nas short a distance as possible to depolarize all the ventricular myocardium.

Whilst clues to these can sometimes be found on history, examination, \\nand ECG, it is imaging that gives the diagnosis. Imaging is also helpful for conditions \\nthat are not primarily due to deformities but which aff ect the way the heart func-\\ntions. For example, after an MI the aff ected territory may be hypokinetic. Stress \\ntechniques allow us to observe the heart at rest and then under stress, comparing \\nthe perfusion and function in the two states. Cardiac \\nMRI is a rapidly expanding area \\nalthough not yet available in all major hospitals.\\nChest X-ray The humble chest X-ray provides just a snapshot of the heart and little \\ndetail but can be an important source of information and is often the only immedi-\\nately accessible imaging modality for a new or newly unwell patient. An enlarged \\nheart (cardiothoracic ratio \\n>0.5) suggests congestive heart failure; signs of pulmo-\\nnary oedema suggest decompensated heart failure (see ﬁ g 3.38); a globular heart \\nmay indicate pericardial eff usion (ﬁ g 3.14); metal wires and valves will show up, \\nevidencing previous cardiothoracic surgery; dextrocardia may explain a bizarre ECG; \\nand rib notching may be an important clue in coarctation of the aorta (p156).\\nEchocardiography This is the workhorse of cardiological imaging. Ultrasound is \\nused t\\no give real-time images of the moving heart. This can be transthoracic ( TTE) \\nor transoesophageal (TOE), at rest, during exercise, or after infusion of a pharmaco-\\nlogical stressor (eg dobutamine). If the patient is too unwell to be moved, an echo \\nmachine can be brought to them and continuous \\nTOE imaging may be used as a guide \\nduring surgery. Increasingly pocket-sized echo machines are used for a quick assess-\\nment of an unwell patient, to be followed by a formal scan later. See p\\n110.\\nCardiac CT This can provide detailed information about cardiac structure and func-\\ntion. CT angiography (ﬁ g 3.15) permits contrast-enhanced imaging of coronary ar-\\nteries during a single breath hold with very low radiation doses. It can diagnose \\nsigniﬁ cant (\\n>50%) stenosis in coronary artery disease with an accuracy of 89%. \\nCT coronary angiography has a negative predictive value of >99%, which makes it \\nan eff ective non-invasive alternative to routine transcatheter coronary angiography \\nto rule out coronary artery disease.6 Medications are often given to slow the heart \\ndown and the imaging may be ‘gated’, meaning the scanner is programmed to take \\nimages at times corresponding to certain points on the patient’s \\nECG. This allows \\ncharacterization of the heart at diff erent points in the cardiac cycle. See p740.\\nCardiac MR A radiation-free method of characterizing cardiac structure and func-\\ntion including viability of myocardium. By varying the settings, diff erent defects can \\nbe found. MR is the ﬁ rst-choice imaging method to look at diseases that directly af-\\nfect the myocardium (ﬁ g 3.16). Nowadays, pacemakers are available which are safe \\nfor MR scanning—check MR safety with your cardiac technicians before requesting \\nMR for patients with pacemakers in situ. See p740.\\nNuclear imaging P erfusion is assessed at rest and with exercise- or pharmacolog-\\nically-induced stress. This test is particularly useful for assessing whether myocar-\\ndium distal to a blockage is viable and so whether stenting or \\nCABG will be of value. \\nIf hypoperfusion is ‘ﬁ xed’, ie present at rest and under stress, the hypoperfused area \\nis probably scar tissue and so non-viable. If hypoperfusion is ‘reversible’ at rest, the \\nmyocardium may beneﬁ  t from improved blood supply.

Several views \\nare possible, including long axis, short axis, 4-chamber, and subcostal. 2D echocar-\\ndiography is good for visualizing conditions such as: congenital heart disease, LV \\naneurysm, mural thrombus, LA myxoma, septal defects.\\n3D echocardiography: Now possible with matrix array probes, and is termed 4D (3D + \\ntime) if the images are moving.\\nDoppler and colour-ﬂ o w echocardiography: Diff erent coloured jets illustrate ﬂ  ow \\nand gradients across valves and septal defects (p156) (Doppler eff ect, p736).\\nTissue Doppler imaging: This employs Doppler ultrasound to measure the velocity \\no\\nf myocardial segments over the cardiac cycle. It is particularly useful for assessing \\nlongitudinal motion—and hence long-axis ventricular function, which is a sensitive \\nmarker of systolic and diastolic heart failure.\\nTransoesophageal echocardiography (TOE): More sensitive than transthoracic echo-\\ncar\\ndiography (TTE) as the transducer is nearer to the heart. Indications: diagnosing \\naortic dissections; assessing prosthetic valves; ﬁ nding cardiac source of emboli, and \\nIE/SBE. Contraindicated in oesophageal disease and cervical spine instability.\\nStress echocardiography: Used to evaluate ventricular function, ejection fraction, \\nm\\nyocardial thickening, regional wall motion pre- and post-exercise, and to charac-\\nterize valvular lesions. Dobutamine or dipyridamole may be used if the patient can-\\nnot exercise. Inexpensive and as sensitive/speciﬁ  c as a thallium scan (p\\n741).\\nUses of echocardiography\\nQ\\nuantiﬁ cation of global LV function: Heart failure may be due to systolic or diastol-\\nic v\\nentricular impairment (or both). Echo helps by measuring end-diastolic volume. If \\nthis is large, systolic dysfunction is the likely cause. If small, diastolic. Pure forms of \\ndiastolic dysfunction are rare. Diff erentiation is important because vasodilators are \\nless useful in diastolic dysfunction as a high ventricular ﬁ  lling pressure is required.\\nEcho is also useful for detecting focal and global hypokinesia, \\nLV aneurysm, mural \\nthrombus, and LVH (echo is 5–10 times more sensitive than ECG in detecting this).\\nEstimating right heart haemodynamics: Doppler studies of pulmonary artery ﬂ ow  \\nand tricuspid regurgitation allow evaluation of RV function and pressures.\\nValve disease: The technique of choice for measuring pressure gradients and valve \\noriﬁ \\nce areas in stenotic lesions. Detecting valvular regurgitation and estimating its \\nsigniﬁ cance is less accurate. Evaluating function of prosthetic valves is another role.\\nCongenital heart disease: Establishing the presence of lesions, and signiﬁ cance.\\nEndocarditis: Vegetations may not be seen if <2mm in size. TTE with colour Doppler \\nis best for aortic regurgitation (AR). TOE is useful for visualizing mitral valve vegeta-\\ntions, leaﬂ et perforation, or looking for an aortic root abscess.\\nPericardial effusion: Best diagnosed by echo. Fluid may ﬁ rst accumulate between \\nthe posterior pericardium and the left ventricle, then anterior to both ventricles and \\nanterior and lateral to the right atrium. There may be paradoxical septal motion.\\nHCM: (p152) Echo features include asymmetrical septal hypertrophy, small LV cavity, \\ndilated left atrium, and systolic anterior motion of the mitral valve.\\n_OHCM_10e.indb   110_OHCM_10e.indb   110 02/05/2017   19:0602/05/2017   19:06'),\n",

In the \\nUK, the majority are performed as day-case procedures.\\nIndications\\n  • Coronary artery disease: diagnostic (assessment of coronary vessels and graft pa-\\nt\\nency); therapeutic (angioplasty, stent insertion), ﬁ g 3.18b.\\n  • Valvular disease: diagnostic (pressures indicate severity); therapeutic valvuloplas-\\nt\\ny (if the patient is too ill or declines valve surgery).\\n  • Congenital heart disease: diagnostic (assessment of severity of lesions by meas-\\nuring pr\\nessures and saturations); therapeutic (balloon dilatation or septostomy).\\n  • Other: cardiomyopathy; pericardial disease; endomyocardial biopsy.\\nPre-procedure checks\\n  • Brief history/examination; NB: peripheral pulses, bruits, aneurysms.\\n  • Investigations: FBC, U&E, LFT, clotting screen, CXR, ECG.\\n  • Consent for procedure, including possible extra procedures, eg consent for angio-\\nplast\\ny if planning to do angiography as you may ﬁ  nd a lesion that needs stenting. \\nExplain reason for procedure and possible complications.\\n  • IV access, ideally in the left hand.\\n  • Patient should be nil by mouth (NBM) from 6h before the procedure.\\n  • Patients should take all their morning drugs (and pre-medication if needed)—but \\nwithhold oral hypoglycaemics.\\nPost-procedure checks\\n  • Pulse, BP, arterial puncture site (for bruising or swelling), foot pulses.\\n  • Investigations: FBC and clotting (if suspected blood loss), ECG.\\nComplications\\n  • Haemorrhage: apply ﬁ  rm pressure over puncture site. If you suspect a false aneu-\\nrysm, ultrasound the swelling and consider surgical repair. Haematomas are high \\nrisk for infections.\\n  • Contrast reaction: this is usually mild with modern contr\\n ast agents.\\n  • Loss of peripheral pulse: may be due to dissection, thrombosis, or arterial spasm. \\nOccurs in \\n<1% of brachial catheterizations. Rare with femoral catheterization.\\n  • Angina: ma y occur during or after cardiac catheterization. Usually responds to \\nsublingual GTN; if not, give analgesia and IV nitrates.\\n  • Arrhythmias: usually transient. Manage along standard lines.\\n  • Pericardial eff  usion: suspect if unexplained continued chest pain. May need drain \\ndepending on severity and haemodynamic status.\\n  • Pericardial tamponade: r are, but should be suspected if the patient becomes hypo-\\ntensive and anuric. \\ue031\\ue031 Urgent pericardial drain.\\n  • Infection: post-catheter pyrexia is usually due to a contrast reaction. If it persists \\nf\\nor >24h, take blood cultures before giving antibiotics.\\nMortality <1 in 1000 patients, in most centres.\\nIntracardiac electrophysiology This catheter technique can determine types and \\norigins o\\nf arrhythmias, and locate and ablate problem areas, eg aberrant pathways \\nin WPW or arrhythmogenic foci.

Used in low dose \\n(eg 75mg/24h PO) for secondary prevention following MI, TIA/stroke, and for patients \\nwith angina or peripheral vascular disease. May have a role in primary prevention.7 \\nADP receptor antagonists (eg clopidogrel, prasugrel, ticagrelor) also block platelet \\naggregation, but may cause less gastric irritation. They have a role if truly intoler-\\nant of aspirin; with aspirin after coronary stent insertion; and in acute coronary \\nsyndrome. Glycoprotein \\nIIb/IIIa antagonists (eg tiroﬁ  ban) have a role in unstable \\nangina/MI.8\\nAnticoagulants See p350. Direct oral anticoagulants (DOACs, previously NOACs), eg \\nXa inhibitors (eg apixaban) and direct thrombin inhibitors (dabigatran), are increas-\\ningly replacing warfarin\\n9 for treatment of AF and clots, see p350. Warfarin remains \\nthe anticoagulant of choice for mechanical valves. Anticoagulants used in ACS include \\ntreatment dose LMWH, fondaparinux (Xa inhibitor), & bivalirudin (thrombin inhibitor).\\n\\ue020-block ers Block \\ue020-adr enoceptors, thus antagonizing the sympathetic nervous \\nsystem. Blocking \\ue020 1-receptors is negatively inotropic and chronotropic; blocking \\n\\ue0202-receptors induces peripheral vasoconst riction and bronchoconstriction. Drugs \\nvary in their \\ue0201/\\ue0202 select ivity (eg propranolol is non-selective, and bisoprolol relative-\\nly \\ue0201 selective), but this does not seem to alter their clinical effi  cacy. Uses: Angina, \\nh\\nypertension, anti dysrhythmic, post MI (\\ue001mortality), heart failure (with caution). CI: \\nSevere asthma/COPD, heart block. SES: Lethargy, erectile dysfunction, \\ue001joie de vivre, \\nnightmares, headache.\\nACE inhibitors These are used in hypertension (HT), heart failure, and post-MI. First \\ndose HT is a concern in patients with severe CCF and malignant HT. In CCF patients, \\nreduce diuretic dose initially and use long-acting ACE-i. Monitor U&E when starting or \\nraising ACE-i dose, a creatinine rise of >20% is concerning. If the patient starts ACE-i \\nprior to discharge, ask the GP to check U&E in 1–2 weeks. If renal function deteriorates \\nmarkedly, consider investigating for renal artery stenosis. The risk to the kidneys is \\ngreater when the patient is unwell. Hold in \\nAKI and hyperkalaemia; avoid starting if \\nthe patient is dehydrated. SES: Include dry cough and urticaria.\\nDiuretics\\n  • Loop diuretics (eg fur osemide) are used in heart failure, and inhibit the Na/2Cl/K \\nco-transporter. SES: dehydration, \\ue001Na+,\\ue001K+, \\ue001Ca2+, ototoxic\\n  • Thiazides and thiazide-like diuretics are used in hypertension (eg indapamide) and \\nheart f\\nailure (eg metolazone). SE: \\ue001K+, \\ue000Ca2+, \\ue001Mg2+, \\ue000urate (±gout), impotence (NB: \\nsmall doses, eg chlortalidone 25mg/24h rarely cause signiﬁ cant SEs)\\n  • Potassium-sparing diuretics: aldost erone antagonists (eg spironolactone, \\neplerenone) directly block aldosterone receptors; amiloride blocks the epithelial \\nsodium channel in the distal convoluted tubules.\\nVasodilators Used in heart f\\n ailure, IHD, and hypertension. Nitrates (p116) preferen-\\ntially dilate veins and the large arteries, \\ue001 ﬁ lling pressure (pre-load), while hydrala-\\nzine (often used with nitrates) primarily dilates the resistance vessels, thus \\ue001 BP \\n(after-load). Prazosin (an \\ue025-blocker) dilates arteries and veins.\\nCalcium antagonists T hese \\ue001 cell entry of Ca 2+ via voltage-sensitive channels in \\nsmooth muscle, thereby promoting coronary and peripheral vasodilat ion and reduc-\\ning myocardial oxygen consumption. All current drugs block L-type Ca2+ channels. \\nHowever, their eff ects diff er because of diff  erential binding properties.\\n  • The dih ydropyridines, eg nife dipine, amlodipine, are mainly peripheral vasodilators \\n(also dilate coronary arteries) and cause a reﬂ ex tachycardia, so are often used \\nwith a \\ue020-blocker. They are used mainly in hypertension and angina.\\n  • The non-dih ydropyridines —verapamil and diltiazem—also slow conduction at the \\nAV and SA nodes and may be used to treat hypertension, angina, and dysrhythmias. \\n\\ue031 Don’t give non-dihydropyridines with \\ue020-block ers (risk of severe bradycardia ± LVF).\\nSES: Flushes, headache, ankle oedema (diuretic unresponsive), \\ue001LV function, gingival \\nhypertrophy.

It is used to slow the pulse in fast AF (p130; aim for \\n\\ue005100). As it is a weak +ve inotrope, its role in heart failure in sinus rhythm may be \\nbest reserved if symptomatic despite optimal ACE-i therapy; 10 here there is little ben-\\neﬁ t vis-à-vis mortality (but admissions for worsening CCF are \\ue001 by ~25%).11 Elderly \\npeople are at \\ue000risk of toxicity: use lower doses. Measure plasma levels >6h post-dose \\n(p756). Typical dose: 500mcg stat PO, repeated after 12h, then 125mcg (if elderly) to \\n250mcg/d PO OD (62.5mcg/d is almost never enough). IV dose: 0.75–1mg in 0.9% NaCl \\nover 2h. \\ue000Toxicity risk if: \\ue001K+, \\ue001Mg2+, or \\ue000Ca2+. t½ ≈ 36h. If on digoxin, use less energy \\nin cardioversion (start at 5J). \\ue007If on amiodarone, halve the dose of digoxin. SES: \\nAny arrhythmia (supravent ricular tachycardia with AV block is suggestive), nausea, \\n\\ue001appetite, yellow vision, confusion, gynaecomastia. If toxicity is suspected, do an ECG \\n(ﬁ g 3.19), digoxin levels, and check K +, Mg2+, and Ca2+. If toxicity is conﬁ rmed, stop \\ndigoxin, correct electrolyte imbalances, treat arrhy thmias, and consider IV DigiFab® \\n(p842). CIS: HCM; WPW syndrome (p133).\\nFig 3.19 This ECG shows the classic ‘reverse \\ntick’ of digoxin toxicity: downsloping ST \\nwave with rapid upstroke back to isoelec-\\ntric line. The bradycardia is also suggestive \\nof digoxin toxicity. \\nDrugs that slow conduction through the atrioventricular node ( AVN) include di-\\ngoxin, verapamil, and adenosine. Uses include cardioverting AVNRT and diagnos-\\ning atrial tachycardias.\\nDrugs that slow AVN conduction should be avoided in patients with aberrant \\npathways (eg WPW) as blocking the AVN can increase conduction via the alterna-\\ntive pathways. AVN blockers are contraindicated in patients with or at risk of VT, eg \\nthose with long QT syndrome.\\nDrugs that slow conduction through the atrioventricular node\\nSodium channel blockers Class I anti-arrhythmics. Procainamide ( 1a) and lido-\\ncaine (1b) can be used to terminate VT. NB QT interval may be prolonged. Flecainide \\n(1c) is useful for AF cardioversion in patients without contraindications, and for ar-\\nrhythmia prophylaxis in patients with WPW or troublesome paroxysmal AF. CIS: Heart \\nfailure, IHD, valve disease, and heart block.\\nAmiodarone A class III anti-arrhythmic. Amiodarone prolongs the cardiac action \\npotential, reducing the potential for tachyarrhythmias. Used in both supra-ventric-\\nular and ventricular tachycardias, including during cardiac arrest. Broad range of \\nside eff  ects incl. thyroid disease, liver disease, pulmonary ﬁ  brosis and peripheral \\nneuropathy. Monitor TFTs and LFTs every 6 months.\\nIvabradine Blocks the pacemaker ‘funny current’, slowing pulse rate without sig-\\nniﬁ cantly dropping blood pressure. Used in angina, heart failure, and (off  -licence) \\nin autonomic tachycardia syndromes. CIS: Acute MI, bradycardia, long QT syndrome, \\nshock. Many drug interactions, including with calcium antagonists.\\nStatins Statins (eg simvastatin, p690) inhibit the enzyme HMG-COA reductase, which \\ncauses de novo synthesis of cholesterol in the liver. This increases LDL receptor ex-\\npression by hepatocytes leading to \\ue001circulating LDL cholesterol. More eff ective if \\ngiven at night, but optimum dose and target plasma cholesterol are unknown. SES: \\nMuscle aches, abdominal discomfort, \\ue000transaminases (eg ALT), \\ue000CK, myositis, rarely \\nrhabdo myolysis (more common if used with ﬁ brates).

Associated symptoms: \\ndyspnoea, nausea, sweatiness, faintness. Features that make angina less likely: pain \\nthat is continuous, pleuritic or worse with swallowing; pain associated with palpita-\\ntions, dizziness or tingling.\\nCauses Atheroma. Rarely: anaemia; coronary artery spasm; AS; tachyarrhythmias; \\nHCM; arteritis/small vessel disease (microvascular angina/cardiac syndrome X).\\nTypes of angina Stable angina: Induced by eff ort, relieved by rest.

Caution if heart failure, \\nelderly, weight <60kg or prolonged QT interval.\\n  • Nicorandil: a K+ channel activator. Start with 5–10mg BD. CI: acute pulmonary oede-\\nma, severe hypotension, hypovolaemia, LV failure.\\nRevascularization:  Considered when optimal medical therapy proves inadequate.\\n  • Percutaneous coronary intervention ( PCI): (p112) a balloon is inﬂ ated inside the \\nstenosed vessel, opening the lumen. A stent is usually inserted to reduce the risk \\nof re-stenosis. Dual antiplatelet therapy (\\nDAPT; usually aspirin and clopidogel) is \\nrecommended for at least 12 months after stent insertion to reduce the risk of in-\\nstent thrombosis. Specialist advice should be sought regarding antiplatelets if the \\npatient has a high bleeding risk or requires surgery.\\n  •\\nCABG: (p123) compared to PCI, patients undergoing CABG are less likely to need re-\\npeat revascularization and those with multivessel disease can expect better out-\\ncomes.

Controversial risk factors include: stress, type A \\npersonality, LVH, ﬁ brinogen\\ue000, hyperinsulinaemia, \\ue000homocysteine levels, ACE genotype.\\nIncidence 5/1000 per annum (UK) for ST-segment elevation (declining in UK & USA).\\nDiagnosis An increase in cardiac biomarkers (eg troponin) and either: symptoms of \\nischaemia, ECG changes of new ischaemia, development of pathological Q waves, new \\nloss of myocardium, or regional wall motion abnormalities on imaging.\\nSymptoms Acute central chest pain, lasting >20min, often associated with nausea, \\nsweatiness, dyspnoea, palpitations. ACS without chest pain is called ‘silent’; mostly \\nseen in elderly and diabetic patients. Silent MIs may present with: syncope, pulmo-\\nnary oedema, epigastric pain and vomiting, post-operative hypotension or oliguria, \\nacute confusional state, stroke, and diabetic hyperglycaemic states.\\nSigns Distress, anxiety, pallor, sweatiness, pulse \\ue000 or \\ue001, BP \\ue000 or \\ue001, 4th heart sound. \\nThere may be signs of heart failure (\\ue000JVP, 3rd heart sound, basal crepitations) or a \\npansystolic murmur (papillary muscle dysfunction/rupture, VSD). Low-grade fever \\nmay be present. Later, a pericardial friction rub or peripheral oedema may develop.\\nTests ECG: (See ﬁ g 3.21.) STEMI: classically, hyperacute (tall) T waves, ST elevation, \\nor new LBBB occur within hours. T-wave inversion and pathological Q waves follow \\nover hours to days (p98). NSTEMI/unstable angina: ST depression, T wave inversion, \\nnon-speciﬁ c changes, or normal. \\ue007In 20% of MI, the ECG may be normal initially. \\nPaced ECGs and ECGs with chronic bundle branch block are unhelpful for diagnos-\\ning NSTEMIs14 and may hinder STEMI15 diagnosis; in these cases, clinical assessment \\nand troponin levels are especially important. CXR: Look for cardiomegaly, pulmonary \\noedema, or a widened mediastinum. Don’t routinely delay treatment whilst waiting \\nfor a \\nCXR. Blood: FBC, U&E, glucose, lipids, cardiac enzymes. Cardiac enzymes: (See \\nBOX ’Troponin‘.) Cardiac troponin levels ( T and I) are the most sensitive and spe-\\nciﬁ c markers of myocardial necrosis. Diff  erent hospitals use diff  erent assays: check \\nthe required timing of troponin blood samples where you work (eg two samples 3h \\napart). Other cardiac enzymes (see ﬁ g 3.22) are sensitive but less speciﬁ  c; their role \\nin ACS diagnosis is decreasing as troponin testing improves.  Echo: R egional wall \\nabnormalities.\\nDiff er ential diagnosis (p 94.) Stable angina, pericarditis, myocarditis, Takotsubo \\ncardiomyopathy (p145), aortic dissection (p655), PE, oesophageal reﬂ ux/spasm, pneu-\\nmothorax, musculoskeletal pain, pancreatitis.\\nManagement See p120, pp798–801.\\nMortality 50% of deaths occur within 2h of onset of symptoms. Up to 7% die before \\ndischarge. Worse prognosis if: elderly, LV failure, and ST changes. 16\\n_OHCM_10e.indb   118_OHCM_10e.indb   118 02/05/2017   19:0602/05/2017   19:06'),\n",

Increasingly, high-sensitivity troponins are used \\nalone for routine investigation of ACS. \\nFig 3.21 Sequential ECG changes following acute MI.\\nTroponins are proteins involved in cardiac and skeletal muscle contraction \\n(ﬁ g 3.23). When myocardial cells are damaged, troponins are released and en-\\nter the bloodstream. The levels of troponin in the blood can therefore help with \\ndiagnosing myocardial damage. Troponins I and T are most speciﬁ c to the heart.\\nTroponin levels are most commonly measured when ACS is suspected. In this \\ncircumstance, one would expect troponin levels to rise in the hours following the \\ninsult (ﬁ g 3.22). Troponin levels can be high with other causes of myocardial dam-\\nage, for example myocarditis, pericarditis, and ventricular strain. With these con-\\nditions, the troponin levels are likely to change little hour by hour as the insults are \\nongoing. Discrete episodes of tachyarrhythmias may cause troponin rises similar \\nto in ACS. Troponin levels can also be raised iatrogenically, eg following CPR, DC \\ncardioversion, ablation therapy.\\nA troponin rise may have a non-cardiac aetiology. This can be indirectly related \\nto the heart, eg a massive PE causing right ventricular strain, or have no clear car-\\ndiac connection, eg subarachnoid haemorrhage, burns, or sepsis. A common cause \\nof consistently elevated troponin is renal failure. Hence, when measuring troponin, \\nchange in level is often more important than the level itself. \\nFig 3.23 Diagram of myocardial contraction unit.

Urgent \\nrevascularization is essential. \\ue022p796.\\n2       ACS without ST elevation: serial troponins are needed to diff erentiate non-ST el-\\nevated MIs (NSTEMIs) (trop rise) from unstable angina (no trop rise). \\ue022p798.\\nAfter the immediate actions described on pp 796–9, treatment of ACS17 focuses on \\nmanaging symptoms, secondary prevention of further cardiovascular disease, revas-\\ncularization (if not already undertaken), and addressing complications.\\nSymptom control\\nManage chest pain with PRN GTN and opiates. If this proves insuffi  cient, consider a \\nGTN infusion (monitor BP, omit if recent sildenaﬁ l use). If pain is deteriorating, seek \\nsenior help. Manage symptomatic heart failure, p136.\\nModify risk factors\\n  • Patients should be strongly advised and helped to stop smoking (p93).\\n  • Identify and treat diabetes mellitus, hypertension, and hyperlipidaemia.\\n  • Advise a diet high in oily ﬁ  sh, fruit, vegetables, & ﬁ bre, and low in saturated fats.\\n  • Encourage daily exercise. Refer to a cardiac rehab programme.\\n  • Mental health: ﬂ ag to the patient’s GP if depression or anxiety are present—these \\nare independently associated with poor cardiovascular outcomes.\\nOptimize cardioprotective medications\\n  • Antiplatelets: aspirin (75mg OD) and a second antiplatelet agent (eg clopidogrel) \\nfor at least 12 months to \\ue001vascular events (eg MI, stroke). Consider adding a PPI (eg \\nlansoprazole) for gastric protection.\\n  • Anticoagulate, eg with fondaparinux, until discharge.\\n  • \\ue020-block ade reduces myocardial oxygen demand. Start low and increase slowly, \\nmonitoring pulse and BP. If contraindicated, consider verapamil or diltiazem.\\n  • ACE-i in patients with LV dysfunction, hypertension, or diabetes unless not tolerated \\n(consider ARB). Titrate up slowly, monitoring renal function.\\n  • High-dose statin, eg atorvastatin 80mg.\\n  • Do an echo to assess LV function. Eplerenone improves outcomes in MI patients \\nwith heart failure (ejection fraction <40%).\\nRevascularization\\n  • STEMI patients and very high-risk NSTEMI patients (eg haemodynamically unstable) \\nshould receive immediate angiography ± PCI. NSTEMI patients who are high risk (eg \\nGRACE score >140) should have angiography within 24h; intermediate risk (eg GRACE \\n109–140) within 3d; low-risk patients may be considered for non-invasive testing.\\n  • Patients with multivessel disease may be considered for CABG instead of PCI (p123).\\nManage complications See p122.\\nDischarge Address any questions the patient has.

The sinus node becomes dysfunctional, in some cases slowing to the \\npoint of sinus bradycardia or sinus pauses, in others generating tachyarrhythmias \\nsuch as atrial ﬁ brillation and atrial tachycardia.\\nSymptoms: Syncope and pre-syncope, light-headedness, palpitations, breathless-\\nness.\\nManagement:\\n  • Thromboembolism prophylaxis if episodes of \\nAF are detected.\\n  • Permanent pacemakers for patients with symptomatic bradycardia or sinus \\npauses.\\nSome patients de\\nvelop a ‘ tachy brady syndrome’, suff  ering from alternating \\ntachycardic and bradycardic rhythms. This can prove diffi  cult to treat medically \\nas treating one circumstance (eg tachycardia) increases the risk from the other. \\nPacing for bradycardic episodes in combination with rate-slowing medications for \\ntachycardic episodes may be required if the patient is symptomatic or unstable.\\nSick sinus syndrome\\nFig 3.25 This is a recording from a loop recorder, each \\nline follows on from the one above.

P-wave morphol-\\nogy and P-P intervals vary. Usually associated with COPD.\\nPrinciples of management See p807.\\n\\ue007\\ue007If the patient is compromised, use DC cardioversion (p770).\\n  • Identify and treat the underlying rhythm: eg treating sinus tachycardia secondary \\nto deh\\nydration with IV ﬂ uids; treating multifocal sinus tachycardia secondary to \\nCOPD by correcting hypoxia and hypercapnia; treating focal atrial tachycardia sec-\\nondary to digoxin toxicity with digoxin-speciﬁ c antibody fragments; treating AVRT \\nsecondary to WPW with ﬂ ecainide, propafenone, or amiodarone; for atrial ﬁ brilla-\\ntion (AF) and ﬂ  utter see p130.\\n  • If AVNRT or AVRT are suspected, consider transiently blocking the AVN. This should \\nbreak the circuit of an atrio-ventricular re-entry rhythm, allowing sinus rhythm to \\nre-establish. If the underlying rhythm is actually atrial in origin (eg ﬂ utter or atrial \\ntachycardia), \\nAVN blockade will not treat the rhythm but the paused ventricular \\nactivity will unmask the atrial rhythm (ﬁ g 3.28), aiding diagnosis and management. \\nAVN blockade can be achieved by:\\n1       Vagal manoeuvres: carotid sinus massage, Valsalva manoeuvre (eg blowing into \\na syringe).\\n2\\n      IV adenosine: see p806.\\n  • In some cases, narrow complex tachyarrhythmias cause symptomatic episodes of \\nsuffi  \\ncient severity and frequency to warrant more invasive treatment, eg ablation \\ntherapy for accessory pathways. \\nBinge drinking in a person without any clinical evidence of heart disease may \\nresult in acute cardiac rhythm and/or conduction disturbances, which is called \\nholiday heart syndrome (note that recreational use of marijuana may have similar \\neff ects).

The \\natrioventricular node (AVN) receives \\nthis activity, pauses, then passes it \\non, down the bundle of His which \\nsplits into left and right bundle \\nbranches. These cause depolariza-\\ntion of the ventricular myocardium \\nfrom bottom (apex) to top (outﬂ ow \\ntracts).\\nRegular rhythm tachycardia\\nSee ﬁ g 3.27.\\nA. Sinus tachycardia:  Conduction \\noccurs as per ﬁ g 3.26 but impulses \\nare initiated at a high frequency. \\nCauses include infection, pain, ex-\\nercise, anxiety, dehydration, bleed, \\nsystemic vasodilation (eg in sepsis), \\ndrugs (caff  eine, nicotine, salbuta-\\nmol), anaemia, fever, PE, hyperthy-\\nroidism, pregnancy, CO2 retention, \\nautonomic neuropathy (eg inappro-\\npriate sinus tachycardia).\\nB. Focal atrial tachycardia:  A \\ngroup of atrial cells act as a pace-\\nmaker, out-pacing the SAN. P-wave \\nmorphology (shape) is diff erent to \\nsinus.\\nC. Atrial ﬂ utter: Electrical activity circles the atria 300 times per minute, giving a \\n‘sawtooth’ baseline, see ﬁ g 3.35. The AVN passes some of these impulses on, result-\\ning in ventricular rates that are factors of 300 (150, 100, 75).\\nD. Atrioventricular re-entry tachycardia:  (AVRT) An accessory pathway (eg in \\nWolff -Parkinson-White (WPW), p133) allows electrical activity from the ventricles \\nto pass to the resting atrial myocytes, creating a circuit: atria –AVN–ventricles–\\naccessory pathway–atria. This direction is called ‘orthodromic’ conduction and \\nresults in narrow QRS complexes as ventricular depolarization is triggered via the \\nbundles of His. Conduction in the other direction is called ‘antidromic’ and results \\nin broad QRS complexes.\\nE. Atrioventricular nodal re-entry tachycardia:  (AVNRT) Circuits form within the \\nAVN, causing narrow complex tachycardias. This is very common.\\nF. Junctional tachycardia:  Cells in the AVN become the pacemaker, giving nar-\\nrow QRS complexes as impulses reach the ventricles through the normal routes; P \\nwaves may be inverted and late.\\nG. Bundle branch block:  Any of the above conditions can result in broad complex \\ntachycardias if there is bundle branch block (see p100).\\nH. Ventricular tachycardia:  (VT) This can result from circuits, similar to atrial \\nﬂ utter, or from focuses of rapidly-ﬁ  ring cells. The QRS is broad.

Treating for VT when the patient is \\nactually in SVT has less potential for deterioration.\\n  • If WPW is suspected, avoid drugs that slow AV conduction—see p114.\\nDiff er ential diagnosis\\n  • Ventricular ﬁ brillation—chaotic, no pattern, ﬁ g 3.29.\\n  • Ventricular tachycardia (VT), ﬁ gs 3.12, 3.30.\\n  • Torsade de pointes (polymorphic VT)—VT with varying axis (see ﬁ g 3.31), may look \\nlike VF. \\ue000QT interval is a predisposing factor.\\n  • Any cause of narrow complex tachycardias (p126) when in combination with bun-\\ndle branch block or metabolic causes of broad QRS.\\n  • Antidromic AVRT (eg WPW), p127.\\nDiff er entiating VT from SVT with aberrancy This may be diffi  cult; seek expert \\nhelp. Diagnosis is based on the history (IHD increases the likelihood of a ventricular \\narrhythmia), a 12-lead ECG, and the response (or lack thereof) to certain medications. \\nECG ﬁ ndings in favour of VT:\\n  • +ve or Ωve QRS concordance in all chest leads (ie all +ve (R) or all Ωve (QS)).\\n  • QRS >160ms.\\n  • Marked left axis deviation, or ‘northwest axis’ (QRS positive in aVR).\\n  • AV dissociation (Ps independent of QRSs) or 2:1 or 3:1 Mobitz II heart block.\\n  • Fusion beats or capture beats (ﬁ gs 3.32, 3.33).\\n  • RSR’ pattern where R is taller than R’. (R’ taller than R suggests RBBB.)\\nManagement See page 805.\\nVentricular extrasystoles (ectopics) These are common and can be symptomatic—\\npatients describe palpitations, a thumping sensation, or their heart ‘missing a beat’. \\nThe pulse may feel irregular if there are frequent ectopics. On ECG, ventricular ectop-\\nics are broad QRS complexes; they may be single or occur in patterns:\\n  • Bigemin y —ectopic every other beat, see ﬁ g 3.34. ECG machines may disregard the \\nsecond QRS and so calculate the rate to be half the true value.\\n  • T rigeminy —every third beat is an ectopic.\\n  • Couple t —two ectopics together.\\n  • T riplet —three ectopics together.\\nOccasional ventricular ectopics24 in otherwise healthy people are extremely common \\nand rarely signiﬁ  cant. Frequent ectopics (>60/hour), particularly couplets and tri-\\nplets, should prompt testing for underlying cardiac conditions. Post-MI, ventricular \\nectopics are associated with increased risk of dangerous arrhythmias. Pay attention \\nto whether the ectopics all ‘look’ the same on the ECG suggesting a single focus \\n(monomorphic) or may come from multiple foci (polymorphic).

Start heparin in case cardioversion is delayed (see BOX ‘Anti-\\ncoagulation and AF’).\\n  • If the patient is stable & AF started >48h ago or unclear time of onset: rate control \\n(eg with bisoprolol or diltiazem). If rhythm control is chosen, the patient must be \\nanticoagulated for >3wks ﬁ rst.\\n  • Correct electrolyte imbalances (K+, Mg2+, Ca2+); \\ue014 associated illnesses (eg MI, pneu-\\nmonia); and consider anticoagulation (see BOX ‘Anticoagulation and AF’).\\nManaging chronic AF\\nThe main goals are rate control and anticoagulation. Rate control is at least as good \\nas rhythm control,\\n 27 but rhythm control may be appropriate if • symptomatic or CCF \\n• younger • presenting for 1st time with lone AF • AF from a corrected precipitant (eg \\n\\ue000\\ue001U&E). Anticoagulation: See BOX ‘Anticoagulation and AF’.\\nRate control:  \\ue020-block er or rate-limiting Ca 2+ blocker are 1st choice. If this fails, add \\ndigoxin (p115), then consider amiodarone. Digoxin as monotherapy in chronic AF is \\nonly acceptable in sedentary patients. \\ue007Do not give \\ue020-block ers with verapamil. Aim \\nfor heart rate <90bpm at rest and 200 minus age (yrs) bpm on exertion. Avoid getting \\nﬁ xated on a target heart rate.\\nRhythm control: Electiv e DC cardioversion: do echo ﬁ rst to check for intracardiac \\nthrombi. If there is \\ue000risk of cardioversion failure (past failure, or past recurrence) \\ngive amiodarone for \\n4wks before the procedure and 12 months after. Elective phar-\\nmacological cardioversion: ﬂ ecainide is 1st choice (CI if structural heart disease, eg \\nscar tissue from MI: use IV amiodarone instead). In refractory cases, AVN ablation \\nwith pacing, pulmonary vein ablation, or the maze procedure may be considered.28\\nParoxysmal AF: ‘Pill in the pocket’ (eg sotalol or ﬂ ecainide PRN) may be tried if: infre-\\nq uent AF, BP >100mmHg systolic, no past LV dysfunction. Anticoagulate (See BOX \\n‘Anticoagulation and AF’). Consider ablation if symptomatic or frequent episodes.\\nAtrial ﬂ utter See pp130–1, ﬁ g 3.35. Treatment: Similar to AF regarding rate and \\nrhythm control and the need for anticoagulation.29 DC cardioversion is preferred to \\npharmacological cardioversion; start with 70–120J. IV amiodarone may be needed if \\nrate control is proving diffi  cult.

Options include ‘percus-\\nsion pacing’—ﬁ st strikes to the precordium, used only in periarrest situations; trans-\\ncutaneous pacing —electrical stimulation via deﬁ brillator pads (p 770); temporary \\ntransvenous pacing (p776); and a subcutaneously implanted permanent pacemaker.\\nIndications for temporary cardiac pacing include\\n  • Symptomatic bradycardia, unresponsive to atropine.\\n  • After acute ant erior MI, prophylactic pacing is required in:\\n  • complete AV block\\n  • Mobitz type I AV block (Wenckebach)\\n  • Mobitz type II AV block\\n  • non-adjacent bifascicular, or trifascicular block (p100).\\n  • After inf erior MI, pacing may not be needed in complete AV block if reasonably \\nstable, rate is >40–50, and QRS complexes are narrow.\\n  • Suppression of drug-resistant tachyarrhythmias by overdrive pacing, eg SVT, VT.\\n  • Special situations: during general anaesthesia; during cardiac surgery; during elec-\\ntr\\nophysiological studies; drug overdose (eg digoxin, \\ue020-blockers, verapamil).\\n\\ue007See p776 for further details and insertion technique.\\nIndications for a permanent pacemaker (PPM) include\\n  • Complete AV block (Stokes–Adams attacks, asymptomatic, congenital).\\n  • Mobitz type II AV block (p99).\\n  • Persistent AV block after anterior MI.\\n  • Symptomatic bradycardias (eg sick sinus syndrome, p125).\\n  • Heart failure (cardiac resynchronization therapy).\\n  • Drug-resistant tachyarrhythmias.\\nPre-operative assessment Bloods (FBC, clotting screen, renal function), IV cannula, \\nconsent, antibiotics as per local protocol.\\nPost-operative management Prior to discharge, check wound for bleeding or hae-\\nmat\\noma; check lead positions and for pneumothorax on CXR; check pacemaker func-\\ntion. During 1st week, inspect for wound haematoma or dehiscence. Other problems: \\nlead fracture or dislodgement; pacemaker interference (eg from patient’s muscles); \\ninfected device. The battery needs changing every \\n5–10 years. For driving rules see \\np158.\\nPacemaker letter codes These enable pacemaker identiﬁ cation (min is 3 letters):\\n  • 1st letter the chamber paced (A=atria, V=ventricles, D=dual chamber).\\n  • 2nd letter the chamber sensed (A=atria, V=ventricles, D=dual chamber, O=none).\\n  • 3rd letter the pacemaker response (T=triggered, I=inhibited, D=dual).\\n  • 4th letter (R=rate modulation, P=programmable, M=multiprogrammable).\\n  • 5th letter ( P means that in tachy cardia the pacemaker will pace the patient. \\nS means that in tachycardia the pace maker shocks the patient. D=dual ability to \\npace and shock. O=neither of these).\\nCardiac resynchronization therapy (CRT) Improves the synchronization of cardi-\\nac contr\\naction and reduces mortality31 in people with symptomatic heart failure who \\nhave an ejection fraction <35% and a QRS duration >120ms.32 It involves biventricular \\npacing (both septal and lateral walls of the LV) and, if required, also an atrial lead. It \\nmay be combined with a deﬁ brillator (CRT-D).\\nECG of paced rhythms (ﬁ g 3.13 and ﬁ g 3.36). Pacemaker input appears as a vertical \\n‘spike’ on the ECG. This spike can be very small with modern bipolar pacing systems. \\nVentricular pacing usually has a broad QRS morphology (similar to LBBB). Systems are \\nusually programmed ‘on demand’ so will only pace when necessary. Modern systems \\nare generally very reliable but pacing spikes with no capture afterwards suggests \\na problem. Programming of devices is complicated so seek help early if concerned. \\nMany pacemakers store intracardiac electrograms which can be accessed to cor-\\nrelate rhythm with any symptoms.\\n_OHCM_10e.indb   132_OHCM_10e.indb   132 02/05/2017   19:0602/05/2017   19:06'),\n",

These may be clinically silent \\nuntil a fatal attack and are likely to be responsible for most cases of sudden adult \\ndeath syndrome (SADS). They include:\\nWPW syndrome (Wolff -Parkinson-White; ﬁ g 3.37.) Caused by congenital acces-\\nsory conduction pathway between atria and ventricles. Resting ECG shows short \\nPR interval, wide QRS complex (due to slurred upstroke or ‘delta wave’) and ST-T \\nchanges. Two types: WPW type A (+ve \\ue008 wave in V1), WPW type B (Ωve \\ue008 wave in V1). \\nTachycardia can be due to an AVRT or pre-excited AF/atrial ﬂ utter (p130). Manage-\\nment may include ablation of the accessory pathway.\\nLQTS (Long QT syndromes.) These are channelopathies that result in prolonged \\nrepolarization phases, predisposing the patient to ventricular arrhythmias; classi-\\ncally torsades de pointes . \\ue007p804. Conditions associated with LQTS include Jervell \\nand Lange-Nielsen syndrome (p702) and Romano–Ward syndrome (p710).\\nARVC (Arrhythmogenic right ventricular cardiomyopathy.) RV myocardium is re-\\nplaced with ﬁ bro-fatty material. Symptoms: palpitations and syncope during ex-\\nercise. ECG changes include epsilon wave; T inversion and broad QRS in V1–V3.\\nBrugada Sodium channelopathy. Diagnosis: classic coved ST elevation in V1–V3 plus \\nsuggestive clinical history. ECG changes and arrhythmias can be precipitated by \\nfever, medications (www.brugadadrugs.org), electrolyte imbalances, and ischaemia.\\nMany of these patients can be treated medically or conservatively but those at \\nhigh risk may require an implantable cardiac deﬁ brillator (ICD). Screening family \\nmembers is important for picking up undiagnosed cases.\\nCongenital arrhythmogenic cardiac conditions\\nFig 3.37 This patient has Wolff -Parkinson-White syndrome as they have delta waves (slurred QRS \\nupstrokes) in beats 1 and 4 of this rhythm strip.

Ejection fraction (EF) is <40%. Causes: IHD, MI, cardiomyopathy. \\nDiastolic failure:  Inability of the ventricle to relax and ﬁ ll normally, causing \\ue000ﬁ lling \\npressures. Typically EF is >50%, this is termed HFpEF (heart failure with preserved \\nEF). Causes: ventricular hypertrophy, constrictive pericarditis, tamponade, restric-\\ntive cardio myopathy, obesity. NB: systolic and diastolic failure pathophysiology often \\ncoexists.\\nLeft ventricular failure ( LVF): Symptoms: dyspnoea, poor exercise tolerance, fa-\\ntigue, orthopnoea, par\\noxysmal nocturnal dyspnoea ( PND), nocturnal cough (± pink \\nfrothy sputum), wheeze (cardiac ‘asthma’), nocturia, cold peripheries, weight loss.\\nRight ventricular failure ( RVF): Causes: LVF, pulmonary stenosis, lung disease (cor \\npulmonale, see p194). Symptoms: peripheral oedema (up to thighs, sacrum, abdomi-\\nnal wall), ascites, nausea, anorexia, facial engorge ment, epistaxis.\\nLVF and RVF may occur independently, or together as congestive cardiac failure (CCF).\\nAcute heart failure:  Often used exclusively to mean new-onset acute or decom-\\npensation o\\nf chronic heart failure characterized by pulmonary and/or peripheral \\noedema with or without signs of peripheral hypo perfusion. Chronic heart failure:  \\nDe\\nvelops or progresses slowly. Venous congestion is common but arterial pressure \\nis well maintained until very late.\\nLow-output heart failure:  Cardiac output is \\ue001 and f ails to \\ue000 normally with exertion. \\nCauses:\\n  • Excessive preload: eg mitr al regurgitation or ﬂ uid overload (eg renal failure or too \\nrapid IV infusions, particularly in the elderly and those with established HF).\\n  • Pump failure: s ystolic and/or diastolic HF (see above), \\ue001heart rate (eg \\ue020-blockers, \\nheart block, post MI), negatively inotropic drugs (eg most antiarrhythmic agents).\\n  • Chronic excessive afterload:  eg aortic st enosis, hypertension.\\nExcessive preload can cause ventricular dilatation, this exacerbates pump failure. \\nExcessive afterload prompts ventricular muscle thickening (ventricular hypertro-\\nphy), resulting in stiff   walls and diastolic dysfunction.\\nHigh-output heart failure:  This is rare. Here, output is normal or increased in the \\nf\\nace of \\ue000\\ue000needs. Failure occurs when cardiac output fails to meet these needs. It will \\noccur with a normal heart, but even earlier if there is heart disease. Causes: anaemia, \\npregnancy, hyperthyroidism, Paget’s disease, arteriovenous malformation, beriberi. \\nConsequences: initially features of RVF; later LVF becomes evident.\\nDiagnosis Requires symptoms of failure (see above) and objective evidence of car-\\ndiac dy\\nsfunction at rest. For CCF, use the Framingham criteria. 35\\nSigns As described previously plus cyanosis, \\ue001BP, narrow pulse pressure, pulsus al-\\nternans, displaced apex (LV dilatation), RV heave (pulmonary hypertension), signs of \\nvalve diseases. Severity can be graded using the New York classiﬁ cation (see BOX). \\nInvestigations According to NICE, 33 if ECG and B-type natriuretic peptide (BNP; p137) \\nare normal, heart failure is unlikely, and an alternative diagnosis should be consid-\\nered; if either is abnormal, then echocardiography (p\\n110) is required.\\nTests FBC; U&E; BNP; CXR (see ﬁ g 3.38); ECG; echo. ECG may indicate cause (look for \\nevidence of ischaemia, MI, or ventricular hypertrophy). It is rare to get a completely \\nnormal ECG in chronic heart failure. Echocardiography is the key investigation.  36 It \\nmay indicate the cause (MI, valvular heart disease) and can conﬁ  rm the presence or \\nabsence of LV dysfunction. Endomyocardial biopsy is rarely needed.\\nPrognosis Poor with ~25–50% of patients dying within 5yrs of diagnosis. If admis-\\nsion is needed, 5yr mortality ≈75%. Be realistic: in one study, 54% of those dying in \\nthe next 72h had been expected to live for >6months.37\\n_OHCM_10e.indb   134_OHCM_10e.indb   134 02/05/2017   19:0602/05/2017   19:06'),\n",

Nevertheless, U&E should be \\nmonitored, particularly if the patient has known CKD. Eplerenone is an alterna-\\ntive if spironolactone is not tolerated.\\n5       Digo xin: Helps symptoms even in those with sinus rhythm,  and should be con-\\nsidered for patients with LVSD who have signs or symptoms of heart failure \\nwhile receiving standard therapy, including ACE-i and \\ue020-blockers, or in patients \\nwith AF.

An internalized pump forces \\nblood through tubing from the left ventricle to the aorta. To power the pump, the \\npatient attaches the device to the mains electricity, and uses batteries when out \\nand about. Patients with continuous (rather than pulsatile) ﬂ  ow LVADs have no \\npulse (ﬁ g 3.39c) and ascultation will reveal a loud, continuous, mechanical hum. If \\nthe patient collapses and there is no hum, resuscitation should include checking \\nthe LVAD power supply!\\nPulseless patients\\nSecretory granules have long been known to exist in the atria, and if hom ogenized \\natrial tissue is injected into rats, their urine volume (and Na+ excretion) rises; this \\nis because of atrial natriuretic peptide (ANP). BNP is a similar hormone originally \\nidentiﬁ ed from pig brain (hence the B), but most BNP is secreted from ventricular \\nmyocardium. Plasma BNP is closely related to LV pressure and in MI and LV dys-\\nfunction, these hormones can be released in large quantities. Secretion is also \\nincreased by tachycardia, glucocorticoids, and thyroid hormones.\\nRole: ANP and BNP assist the stretched atria and ventricles by increasing GFR and \\ndecreasing renal Na + resorption, thereby reducing ﬂ  uid load; and by relaxing \\nsmooth muscle, thereby decreasing preload.\\nBNP as a biomarker of heart failure:  \\ue000BNP distinguishes heart failure from other \\ncauses of dyspnoea more accurately than other biomarkers and LV ejection frac-\\ntion (sensitivity: >90%; speciﬁ city: 80–90%). The rises are greater with left than \\nright heart failure and with systolic than diastolic dysfunction.\\nWhat BNP threshold for diagnosing heart failure:  If BNP >100ng/L, this ‘diag-\\nnoses’ heart failure better than other clinical variables or clinical judgement (his-\\ntory, examination, and CXR). BNP can be used to ‘rule out’ heart failure if <50ng/L. A \\nBNP >50ng/L does not exclude other coexisting diseases; conditions that can cause \\nBNP rises include tachycardia, cardiac ischaemia, COPD, PE, renal disease, sepsis, he-\\npatic cirrhosis, diabetes, and old age. Also, assays vary, so liaise with your lab.\\nPrognosis in heart failure:  The higher the BNP, the higher the cardiovascular and \\nall-cause mortality (independent of age, NYHA class, previous MI, and LV ejection \\nfraction) and the greater the risk of sudden death. So, a patient whose symptoms \\nare currently well controlled may beneﬁ t from more aggressive treatment if their \\nBNP if persistently raised.\\nNatriuretic peptides\\nFig 3.39 (a) CXR of a patient with a continuous ﬂ ow LVAD.

Usually asymptomatic, so regular screen-\\ning (eg 3-yrly) is a vital task—most preventable deaths are in areas without universal \\nscreening. 45\\nDeﬁ ning hypertension BP has a skewed normal distribution (p751) within the popu-\\nlation, and risk is continuously related to BP, so it is imp ossible to deﬁ ne ‘hyperten-\\nsion’. 46 We choose to select a value above which risk is signiﬁ  cantly increased and \\nthe beneﬁ t of treatment is clear cut, see below. Don’t rely on a single reading—assess \\nover a period of time (how long depends on the BP and the presence of other risk \\nfactors or end-organ damage). Conﬁ rm with 24hr ambulatory BP monitoring (ABPM); \\nor a week of home readings. NB: the diagnostic threshold is lower ~135/85mmHg.\\nWhom to treat All with BP ≥160/100mmHg (or ABPM ≥150/95mmHg). For those \\n≥140/90, the decision depends on the risk of coronary events, presence of diabetes, \\nor end-organ damage; see ﬁ g 3.40. 44 The HYVET study showed that there is even sub-\\nstantial beneﬁ t in treating the over-80s. 47 Lower thresholds may be appropriate for \\nyoung people—BP is on average lower in young people (eg 100–110/60–70 in 18-year-\\nolds) and they have a ‘lifetime’ of risk ahead of them; but evidence to treat is lacking.\\nWhite-coat hypertension Refers to an elevated clinic pr essure, but normal ABPM \\n(day average <135/85).

Usually there is severe \\nhypertension (eg systolic >200, diastolic>130mmHg) + bilateral retinal haemorrhages \\nand exudates; papilloedema may or may not be present. Symptoms are common, \\neg headache ± visual disturbance. It requires urgent treatment, and may also pre-\\ncipitate acute kidney injury, heart failure, or encephalopathy, which are hypertensive \\nemergencies. Untreated, \\n90% die in 1yr; treated, 70% survive 5yrs. It is more com-\\nmon in younger and in black subjects. Look hard for any underlying cause.\\nPrimary or ‘essential’  h ypertension: (Cause unknown.) ~95% of cases.\\nSecondary hypertension: ~5% of cases. Causes include:\\n  • Renal disease: the most common secondary cause. 75% are from intrinsic renal \\ndisease: glomerulonephritis, polyarteritis nodosa (PAN), systemic sclerosis, chronic \\npyelonephritis, or polycystic kidneys. 25% are due to renovascular disease , most \\nfrequently atheromatous (elderly \\ue032 cigarette smokers, eg with peripheral vascular \\ndisease) or rarely ﬁ  bromuscular dysplasia (young \\ue033).\\n  • Endocrine disease: Cushing’s (p\\n224) and Conn’s syndromes (p228), phaeochromo-\\ncytoma (p228), acromegaly, hyperparathyroidism.\\n  • Others: coarctation (p156), pregnancy (OHCS p48), liquorice, drugs: steroids, MAOI, \\noral contraceptive pill, cocaine, amphetamines.\\nSigns and symptoms Usually asymptomatic (except malignant hypertension, see \\nearlier in t\\nopic). Headache is no more common than in the general population. Al-\\nways examine the CVS fully and check for retinopathy. Are there features of an un-\\nderlying cause (phaeochromocytoma, p228, etc.), signs of renal disease, radiofemoral \\ndelay, or weak femoral pulses (coarctation), renal bruits, palpable kidneys, or Cush-\\ning’s syndrome? Look for end-organ damage: \\nLVH, retinopathy and proteinuria—indi-\\ncates severity and duration of hypertension and associated with a poorer prognosis.\\nTests To conﬁ rm diagnosis: ABPM or home BP monitoring. To help quantify overall \\nrisk: Fasting glucose; cholesterol. To look for end-organ damage: ECG or echo (any \\nLV hypertrophy? past MI?); urine analysis (protein, blood). To ‘exclude’ secondary \\ncauses: U&E (eg K +\\ue001 in Conn’s); Ca2+ (\\ue000 in hyperparathyroidism). Special tests: Re-\\nnal ultr\\nasound/arteriography (renal artery stenosis); 24h urinary meta-adrenaline \\n(p228); urinary free cortisol (p225); renin; aldosterone; MR aorta (coarctation).\\n_OHCM_10e.indb   138_OHCM_10e.indb   138 02/05/2017   19:0602/05/2017   19:06'),\n",

Drug \\ntherapy reduces the risk of CVD and death. Almost any adult over 50 would beneﬁ t \\nfrom antihypertensives, whatever their starting BP. 48 Treatment is especially impor-\\ntant if: BP is persistently ≥160/100mmHg or cardio vascular risk \\ue000 (10yr risk of vascular \\ndisease ≥20%), or existing vascular disease or target organ damage (eg brain, kidney, \\nheart, retina) with BP >140/90mmHg. Essential hypertension is not ‘curable’ and long-\\nterm treatment is needed.\\nTreatment goal <140/90mmHg (<130/80 in diabetes, 150/90 if aged >80). Reduce \\nblood pressure slowly; rapid reduction can be fatal, especially in the context of an \\nacute stroke. These may fall—SPRINT49 showed a target of 120/80 was beneﬁ cial.\\nLifestyle changes \\ue001Concomitant risk f actors: stop smoking; low-fat diet. Reduce \\nalcohol and salt intake; increase exercise; reduce weight if obese.\\nDrugs The ALLHAT study suggests that adequate BP reduction is more important than \\nthe speciﬁ  c drug used. 50 However, \\ue020-blockers seem to be less eff ective than other \\ndrugs at reducing major cardiovascular events, particularly stroke. \\ue020-blockers and \\nthiazides may increase the risk of new-onset diabetes, Ca2+-channel blockers appear \\nneutral, and ACE-i or ARB may reduce the risk. 44\\nMonotherapy: If ≥55yrs, and in black patients of any age, 1st choice is a Ca2+-channel \\nantagonist or thiazide. If <55, 1st choice is ACE-i (or ARB if ACE-i intolerant, eg cough). \\n\\ue020-blockers are not 1st line for hypertension, but consider in younger people, particu-\\nlarly if: intolerance or contraindication to ACE-i/ARB, she is a woman of child-bearing \\npotential, or there is \\ue000sympathetic drive.\\nCombination \\ue057: ACE-i + Ca2+-channel antagonist or diuretic is logical, and has been \\ncommonly used in trials. There is little evidence on using 3 drugs but current recom-\\nmendation is ACE-i, Ca2+-channel antagonist, and thiazide. 44 If BP still uncontrolled \\non adequate doses of 3 drugs, add a 4th—consider: spironolactone 25–50mg/24h or \\nhigher-dose thiazide, but monitor U&E. Alternatively, \\ue020-blocker, or selective \\ue025-blocker \\nand get help. Check compliance (urinary drug screen, or observed \\ue057).\\nDrug examples T hiazides: Eg chlortalidone 25–50mg/24h PO mané. SE: \\ue001K+, \\ue001Na+, \\nimpotence. CI: gout. Ca 2+-channel antagonists: Eg nifedipine MR, 30–60mg/24h PO. \\nSE: ﬂ  ushes, fatigue, gum hyperplasia, ankle oedema; avoid short-acting form. ACE-i: \\nEg lisinopril 10–40mg/24h PO (max 40mg/d). ACE-i may be 1st choice if co-existing LVF, \\nor in diabetics (esp. if microalbuminuria, p 314) or proteinuria. SE: cough, \\ue000K+, renal \\nfailure, angio-oedema. CI: bilateral renal artery  or aortic valve stenosis; p 114. ARB: \\nCandesartan (8–32mg/d); caution if valve disease or cardiomyopathy; monitor K +. \\nSE: vertigo, urticaria, pruritus. Useful if ACE-i induces cough. \\ue058-block ers: Eg biso-\\npr\\nolol 2.5–5mg/24h PO. SE: bronchospasm, heart failure, cold peripheries, lethargy, \\nimpotence. CI: asthma; caution in heart failure. Consider aspirin when BP controlled, \\nif aged >55yrs. Add a statin if cholesterol raised. \\ue007Most drugs take 4–8wks to gain \\nmaximum eff  ect: don’t assess effi  cacy with just one BP measurement.\\nMalignant hypertension  ( ﬁ g 3.41) In general, use oral therapy, unless there is \\nencephal opathy or CCF. The aim is for a controlled reduction in BP over days, not \\nhours. Avoid sudden drops in BP as cerebral autoregulation is poor ( \\ue000stroke risk). \\nBed rest; there is no ideal hypotensive, but atenolol or long-acting Ca2+ blockers may \\nbe used PO.\\nEncephalopathy: (Headache, focal CNS signs, seizures, coma.) Aim to reduce BP \\nto ~110mmHg diastolic over 4h. Admit to monitored area. Insert intra-arterial line \\nfor pressure monitoring. Either IV labetalol (eg 50mg IV over 1min, repeated every \\n5min, max 200mg) or sodium nitroprusside infusion (0.5mcg/kg/min IVI titrated up \\nto 8mcg/kg/min, eg 50mg in 1L glucose 5%; expect to give 100–200mL/h for a few \\nhours only, to avoid cyanide risk).\\n\\ue007Never use sublingual nifedipine to reduce BP (rapid drop in BP may cause stroke ). 51\\n_OHCM_10e.indb   140_OHCM_10e.indb   140 02/05/2017   19:0602/05/2017   19:06'),\n",

An \\napical systolic murmur may be the only sign.52\\n  • Arthritis: a migr atory, ‘ﬂ itting’ polyarthritis; usually aff  ects larger joints (75%).\\n  • Subcutaneous nodules: small, mobile, painless nodules on e xtensor surfaces of \\njoints and spine (2–20%).\\n  • Erythema marginatum: (ﬁ g 3.42) geographical-type rash with red, raised edges \\nand clear centre; occurs mainly on trunk, thighs and arms in 2–10% (p562).\\n  • Sydenham’s chorea (St Vitus’ dance): occurs lat e in 10%.

Aff  ective disorders, certain personality types, \\nand traumatic life-experiences increase the risk of cardiac disease, even when life-\\nstyle factors are controlled for.54–56 In ‘broken heart syndrome’ (Takotsubo cardio-\\nmyopathy), ventricular contraction morphology changes in response to emotional \\nor physical stress (ﬁ g 3.43). It mimics a myocardial infarction in terms of clinical \\nhistory, ECG changes, and troponin rises, but the prognosis and management may \\nbe quite diff erent so accurate diagnosis is important.\\nAs physicians, we often focus on explainable physical aspects of disease, but the \\nphysical and psychosocial are inconveniently related and both should be assessed \\nto determine best management. Should an IHD suff  erer be off ered CBT alongside \\ntheir statins? Could a grieving patient’s ‘MI’ be Takotsubo cardiomyopathy? To an-\\nswer these questions we must look beyond ECGs and troponin, to the ‘heart-ache’ \\nof the literary and philosophical kinds.\\nWhat Becomes of the Broken Hearted?\\nFig 3.43 (a) Left ventriculogram of a heart in diastole.

The classic triad includes angina, syncope, and heart failure. Also: \\ndyspnoea; dizziness; faints; systemic emboli if infective endocarditis; sudden death. \\nSigns: Slow rising pulse with narrow pulse pressure (feel for diminished and delayed \\ncar\\notid upstroke—parvus et tardus); heaving, non-displaced apex beat; LV heave; \\naortic thrill; ejection systolic murmur (heard at the base, left sternal edge and the \\naortic area, radiates to the carotids). \\nS1 is usually normal. As stenosis worsens, A2 is \\nincreasingly delayed, giving ﬁ rst a single S2 and then reversed splitting. But this sign \\nis rare. More common is a quiet A2. In severe AS, A2 may be inaudible (calciﬁ ed valve). \\nThere may be an ejection click (pliable valve) or an S4.\\nTests: ECG: LVH with strain pattern; P-mitrale; LAD; poor R-wave progression; LBBB \\nor complete AV block (calciﬁ ed ring). CXR: LVH; calciﬁ  ed aortic valve (ﬁ g 3.44); post-\\nstenotic dilatation of ascending aorta. Echo: diagnostic (p 110). Doppler echo can \\nestimate the gradient across valves: severe stenosis if peak gradient \\ue00640mmHg (but \\nbeware the poor left ventricle not able to generate gradient) and valve area <1cm2. \\nIf the aortic jet velocity is >4m/s (or is increasing by >0.3m/s per yr) risk of complica-\\ntions is increased. 57 Cardiac catheter can assess: valve gradient; LV function; coronary \\nartery disease; risks: emboli generation.\\nDifferential diagnosis: Hypertrophic cardiomyopathy (HCM, p152); aortic sclerosis.\\nManagement: If symptomatic, prognosis is poor without surgery: 2–3yr survival if \\nangina/syncope; 1–2yr if cardiac failure. If moderate-to-severe and treated medi-\\ncally, mortality can be as high as 50% at 2yrs, therefore prompt valve replacement \\n(p148) is usually recommended. In asymptomatic patients with severe AS and a dete-\\nriorating ECG, valve replacement is also recommended. If the patient is not medically \\nﬁ t for surgery, percutaneous valvuloplasty/replacement (TAVI = transcatheter aortic \\nvalve implantation) may be attempted (ﬁ g 3.45).\\nAortic sclerosis Senile degeneration of the valve. There is an ejection systolic mur-\\nmur; but no car\\notid radiation, and normal pulse (character and volume) and S2.\\nAortic regurgitation ( AR) Acute: Infective endocarditis, ascending aortic dis-\\nsection, chest tr\\nauma. Chronic: Congenital, connective tissue disorders (Marfan’s \\ns\\nyndrome, Ehlers–Danlos), rheumatic fever, Takayasu arteritis, rheumatoid arthritis, \\nSLE, pseudoxanthoma elasticum, appetite suppressants (eg fenﬂ uramine, phenter-\\nmine), seronegative arthritides (ankylosing spondylitis, Reiter’s syndrome, psor iatic \\narthropathy), hyper tension, osteogenesis imperfecta, syphilitic aortitis.\\nSymptoms: Exertional dyspnoea, orthopnoea, and PND. Also: palpitations, angina, \\nsyncope, CCF. Signs: Collapsing (water-hammer) pulse (p 42); wide pulse pressure; \\ndisplaced, hyperdynamic apex beat; high-pit ched early diastolic murmur (heard best \\nin expiration, with patient sat forward). Eponyms: Corrigan’s sign: carotid pulsation; \\nde Musset’s sign: head nodding with each heart beat; Quincke’s sign: capillary pulsa-\\ntions in nail beds; Duroziez’s sign: in the groin, a ﬁ  nger compressing the femoral ar-\\ntery \\n2cm proximal to the stethoscope gives a systolic murmur; if 2cm distal, it gives \\na diastolic murmur as blood ﬂ ows backwards; Traube’s sign: ‘pistol shot’ sound over \\nfemoral arteries; an Austin Flint murmur (p46) denotes severe AR.\\nTests: ECG: LVH. CXR: cardiomegaly; dilated ascending aorta; pulmonary oedema. Echo \\nis diagnostic. Cardiac catheterization to assess: severity of lesion; anatomy of aortic \\nroot; LV function; coronary artery disease; other valve disease.\\nManagement: The main goal of medical therapy is to reduce systolic hypertension; \\nACE-i are helpful. Echo every 6–12 months to monitor. Indications for surgery: severe \\nAR with enlarged ascending aorta, increasing symptoms, enlarging LV or deterio-\\nrating LV function on echo; or infective endocarditis refractory to medical therapy. \\nAim to replace the valve before signiﬁ cant LV dysfunction occurs. Predictors of poor \\npost-operative survival: ejection fraction <50%, NYHA class III or IV (p135), duration \\nof CCF >12 months.\\n_OHCM_10e.indb   146_OHCM_10e.indb   146 02/05/2017   19:0602/05/2017   19:06'),\n",

Treatment: Pulmonary valvuloplasty or valvotomy.\\nPulmonary regurgitation Causes: Any cause of pulmonary hypertension (p 194). \\nSigns: Decrescendo murmur in early diastole at the left sternal edge (the Graham \\nSt\\neell murmur if associated with mitral stenosis and pulmonary hypertension).\\nCardiac surgery\\nCardiac surgery has come on a long way since 1923 when Dr Henry Souttar58,59 used \\nhis ﬁ nger to open a stenosed mitral valve in a beating heart.6 Cardiac bypass allows \\nprolonged access to the open, static heart, during which complex and high-precision \\nrepair and replacement of valves and aortic roots can occur. Transcatheter proce-\\ndures are playing an increasing role in the management of cardiovascular disease. \\nKey open heart procedures include:\\nValve replacements Mechanical valves ma\\n y be of the ball-cage (Starr–Edwards), \\ntilting disc (Bjork–Shiley), or double tilting disc (St Jude) type. These valves are very \\ndurable but the risk of thromboembolism is high; patients require lifelong anticoagu-\\nlation. Xenografts  are made from porcine valves or pericardium. These valves are \\nless durable and may require replacement at \\n8–10yrs but have the advantage of not \\nnecessitating anticoagulation. Homografts  are cadaveric valves. They are particu-\\nlarly useful in young patients and in the replacement of infected valves. Complica-\\ntions of prosthetic valves:  systemic embolism, infective endocarditis, haemolysis, \\nstructural valve failure, arrhythmias.\\nCABG See p123.\\nCardiac transplantation Consider this when cardiac disease is se verely curtailing \\nquality of life, and survival is not expected beyond 6–12 months.\\nSurgery for congenital heart defects See p156.\\nAortic root surgery Replacement/repair if dissection or aneurysmal.\\n5 Remember that it is the tricuspid valve which is the valve most vulnerable to events arriving by vein, eg \\npathogens from IV drug abusers or hormones (particularly 5-HT) from carcinoid tumours.\\n6 Souttar’s own description of this landmark case is available online: H S Souttar.

Any fever lasting >1wk in \\nthose known to be at risk7 must prompt blood cultures.61 Acute infective endocarditis \\n(IE) tends to occur on ‘normal’ valves and may present with acute heart failure ± emboli; \\nthe commonest organism is Staph. aureus. Risk factors: skin breaches (dermatitis, IV \\nlines, wounds); renal failure; immunosuppression; DM. Mortality: 5–50% (related to age \\nand embolic events). Endocarditis on abnormal valves tends to run a subacute course. \\nRisk factors: aortic or mitral valve disease; tricuspid valves in IV drug users; coarctation; \\npatent ductus arteriosus; VSD; prosthetic valves. Endocarditis on prosthetic valves may \\nbe ‘early’ (within 60d of surgery, usually Staph. epidermidis, poor prognosis) or ‘late’.\\nCauses Bacteria: Bacteraemia occurs all the time, eg when we chew (not just during \\ndentistry or medical int\\nerventions—which is why routine prophylaxis for such pro-\\ncedures does not make sense). 61 Strep. viridans is the commonest (usually subacute) \\nfollowed by Staph. aureus , Strep. bovis (need colonoscopy ?tumour), Enterococci \\nand Coxiella burnetii. Rarely: HACEK Gram Ωve bacteria (Haemoph ilus–Actinobacil-\\nlus–Cardiobact erium–Eikenella–Kingella); diphther oids; Chlamydia. Fungi: Candida; \\nAsper\\ngillus; Histoplasma. Usually in IV drug abusers, immunocompromised patients \\nor those with prosthetic valves. High mortality, need surgical management. Other: \\nSLE (Libman–Sacks endocarditis); malignancy.\\nSigns Septic signs: Fever, rigors, night sweats, malaise, weight loss, anaemia, \\nspleno meg aly\\n, and clubbing (ﬁ  g 3.46). Cardiac lesions: Any new murmur, or a \\nchange in pr\\ne-existing murmur, should raise the suspicion of endocarditis. Vegeta-\\ntions may cause valve destruction and severe regurgitation, or valve obstruction. An \\naortic root abscess causes prolongation of the PR interval, and may lead to complete \\nAV block. LVF is a common cause of death. Immune complex deposition: Vasculitis \\n(p556) may aff ect any vessel. Microscopic haematuria is common; glomerulonephri-\\ntis and acute kidney injury may occur. Roth spots (boat-shaped retinal haemorrhage \\nwith pale centre); splinter haemorrhages ( ﬁ g \\n3.47); Osler’s nodes (painful pulp in-\\nfarcts in ﬁ  ngers or toes). Embolic phenomena: Emboli may cause abscesses in the \\nr\\nelevant organ, eg brain, heart, kidney, spleen, gut (or lung if right-sided IE) or skin: \\ntermed Janeway lesions (ﬁ g 3.48; painless palmar or plantar macules), which, to-\\ngether with Osler’s nodes, are pathognomonic.\\nDiagnosis Use the Modiﬁ  ed Duke criteria ( BOX ‘Modified Duke criteria’).62, 63 Blood \\ncultur\\nes: Do three sets at diff erent times from diff erent sites at peak of fever. 85–\\n90% are diagnosed from the 1st two sets; 10% are culture-negative. Blood tests:  \\nNormochr\\nomic, normocytic anaemia, neutrophilia, high ESR/CRP. Rheumatoid factor \\npositive (an immunological phenomenon). Also check U&E, Mg2+, LFT. Urinalysis: For \\nmicr\\noscopic haematuria. CXR: Cardiomegaly, pulmonary oedema. Regular ECGs: To \\nlook f\\nor heart block. Echocardiogram: TTE (p110) may show vegetations, but only if \\n>2mm. TOE (p110) is more sensitive, and better for visualizing mitral lesions and pos-\\nsible development of aortic root abscess. CT: To look for emboli (spleen, brain, etc.).\\nTreatment Liaise early with microbiologists and cardiologists.62 Antibiotics: see BOX  \\n‘Antibiotic therapy for infective endocarditis’. Surgery if: Heart failure, valvular ob-\\nstruction; r\\nepeated emboli; fungal IE; persistent bacteraemia; myocardial abscess; \\nunstable infected prosthetic valve. 64\\nPrognosis 50% require surgery. 20% inhospital mortality (Staphs 30%; bowel bac-\\nteria 14%; Streps 6%). 15% recurrence at 2yrs.\\nPrevention Antibiotic prophylaxis is no longer recommended for those at risk of \\nIE undergoing invasive procedures. However, if they are given antibiotics for other \\nreasons during a procedure, the antibiotic should cover the common IE organisms.\\nRecommendations Give clear information about prevention, including:\\n  • The importance of maintaining good oral health.\\n  • Symptoms that may indicate IE and when to seek expert advice.\\n  • The risks of invasive procedures, including non-medical procedures such as body \\npier\\ncing or tattooing.65\\n7 Past IE or rheumatic fever; IV drug abuser; damaged or replaced valve; PPM or ICD; structural congenital \\nheart disease (but not simple ASD, fully repaired VSD, or patent ductus); hypertrophic cardiomyopathy.\\n_OHCM_10e.indb   150_OHCM_10e.indb   150 02/05/2017   19:0602/05/2017   19:06'),\n",

ACHD69 patients are at increased risk of many conditions described else-\\nwhere, for which many of the ‘standard’ investigations and therapies will apply: includ-\\ning arrhythmias (p\\n124), heart failure (p134), and infective endocarditis (p150).\\nInvestigations Echocardiography (± bubble contr ast) is ﬁ  rst line. Increasingly, car-\\ndiac CT and MR are used to provide precise anatomical and functional information. \\nCardiac catheterization generates data on oxygen saturation and pressure in diff er-\\nent vessels and chambers. Exercise testing assesses functional capacity.\\nA few of the more common ACHDs are discussed below:\\nBicuspid aortic valve These work well at birth and go undetected. Many even-\\ntually de\\nvelop aortic stenosis (needing valve replacement) ± aortic regurgitation \\npredisposing to IE/SBE ± aortic dilatation/dissection. Intense exercise may accelerate \\ncomplications, so do yearly echocardiograms on aff ected athletes. 70\\nAtrial septal defect (ASD) A hole connects the atria.\\n  • Ostium secundum def ects: 80% cases; hole high in the septum; often asymptomat-\\nic until adulthood when a L\\ue003R shunt develops. Shunting depends on the compliance \\nof the ventricles. LV compliance decreases with age (esp. if \\ue000BP), so augmenting L\\ue003R \\nshunting; hence dyspnoea/heart failure, typically aged 40–60yrs.\\n  • Ostium primum def ects: associated with AV valve anomalies, eg in Down’s syn-\\ndrome; present in childhood.\\nSigns and symptoms: Chest pain, palpitations, dyspnoea. Arrhythmias incl. AF; \\ue000JVP; \\nwide, ﬁ xed split S2; pulmonary systolic ﬂ ow murmur. Pulmonary hypertension may \\ncause pulmonary or tricuspid regurgitation, dyspnoea and haemoptysis. \\ue000Frequency \\nof migraine. Simple tests: ECG: RBBB with LAD (primum defect) or RAD (secundum \\ndefect). CXR: small aortic knuckle, pulmonary plethora, atrial enlargement. Com-\\nplications: • Reversal of left-to-right shunt, ie Eisen men ger’ s complex: initial  L\\ue003R \\nshunt leads to pulmonary hypertension which increases right heart pressures until \\nthey exceed left heart pressures, hence shunt reversal. This causes cyanosis as de-\\noxygenated blood enters systemic circulation. • Paradoxical emboli eg causing \\nCVAs \\n(vein\\ue003artery via ASD; rare). Treatment: May close spontaenously. If not, primum de-\\nf\\nects are usually closed in childhood. Secundum defects should be closed if sympto-\\nmatic or signs of RV overload. Transcatheter closure is more common than surgical.\\nVentricular septal defect (VSD) A hole connects the ventricles. Causes: Congenital \\n(pr\\nevalence 2:1000 births); acquired (post-MI). Symptoms: May present with severe \\nheart f\\nailure in infancy, or remain asymptomatic and be detected incidentally in \\nlater life. Signs: Classically, a harsh pan s ystolic murmur is heard at the left sternal \\nedge, with a systolic thrill, ± left para sternal heave. Smaller holes, which are haemo-\\ndynamically less signiﬁ  cant, give louder murmurs. Signs of pulmonary hypertension. \\nComplications: AR, IE/SBE, pulmonary hypertension, Eisenmenger’s complex (above), \\nheart failure from volume overload. Tests: ECG: normal, LAD, LVH, RVH. CXR: normal \\nheart size ± mild pulmonary plethora (small VSD) or cardiomegaly, large pulmonary \\narteries and marked pulmonary plethora (large VSD). Cardiac catheter: step up in \\nO2 saturation in right ventricle. Treatment: Initially medical as many close sponta-\\nneously\\n. Indications for surgical closure: failed medical therapy, symptomatic VSD, \\nshunt >3 : 1, SBE/IE. Endovascular closure may be possible. 71\\nCoarctation of the aorta Congenital narrowing of the descending aorta; usually \\noccurs just distal t\\no the origin of the left subclavian artery. More common in boys. \\nAssociations: Bicuspid aortic valve; Turner’s syndrome. Signs: Radiofemoral delay; \\nw\\neak femoral pulse; \\ue000 BP; scapular bruit; systolic murmur (best heard over the left \\nscapula); cold feet. Complications: Heart failure from high afterload; IE; intracer-\\nebral haemorrhage. Tests: CT or MRI-aortogram; CXR may show rib notching as blood \\ndiverts down intercostal arteries to reach the lower body, causing these vessels to \\ndilate and erode local rib bone.

It is also the most common cyanotic heart defect that \\nsurvives to adulthood, accounting for 10% of all ACHD. 72 It is believed to be due to \\nabnormalities in separation of the truncus arteriosus into the aorta and pulmo-\\nnary arteries early in gestation (ﬁ g 3.52).\\nThe ‘tetralogy’ of features are:\\n1       Ventricular septal defect (VSD).\\n2       Pulmonary stenosis.\\n3       Right ventricular hypertrophy.\\n4       The aorta overrides the VSD, accepting right heart \\nblood.\\nA few patients also have an ASD, which makes up the \\npentad of Fallot. \\nPresentation:  Severity of illness depends greatly on \\nthe degree of pulmonary stenosis. Infants may be \\nacyanotic at birth, with a pulmonary stenosis mur-\\nmur as the only initial ﬁ nding. Gradually (especially \\nafter closure of the ductus arteriosus) they become \\ncyanotic due to decreasing ﬂ  ow of blood to the lungs \\nand increasing right-to-left ﬂ  ow across the VSD. Dur-\\ning a hypoxic spell, the child becomes restless and \\nagitated. Toddlers may squat, which is typical of TOF, \\nas it increases peripheral vascular resistance, there-\\nby decreasing the degree of right to left shunt.   Adult patients are often asymp-\\ntomatic. In the unoperated adult patient, cyanosis is common, although extreme \\ncyanosis or squatting is uncommon. In repaired patients, late symptoms include \\nexertional dyspnoea, palpitations, clubbing, RV failure, syncope, and even sudden \\ndeath. Investigations: ECG shows RV hypertrophy with a right bundle-branch \\nblock. CXR may be normal, or show the hallmark of TOF, which is the classic boot-\\nshaped heart ( ﬁ g 3.53). Echocardiography  \\ncan show the anatomy as well as the degree \\nof stenosis. Cardiac CT and cardiac MRI can \\ngive valuable information for planning the \\nsurgery. 73\\nManagement:  Surgery is usually done be-\\nfore 1yr of age, with closure of the VSD and \\ncorrection of pulmonary stenosis.\\nPrognosis:  Without surgery, mortality rate \\nis ~95% by age 20. After repair, 85% of pa-\\ntients survive to 35yrs. Common problems in \\nadulthood include pulmonary regurgitation, \\ncausing RV dilatation and failure; RV outﬂ ow \\ntract obstruction; AR; LV dysfunction; and ar-\\nrhythmias. \\nFallot’s tetralogy: what the non-specialist needs to know\\nFig 3.52 Tetralogy of Fallot.\\nReproduced from Thorne et al., \\nAdult Congenital Heart Disease , \\n2009, with permission from \\nOxford University Press.\\nFig 3.53 Boot-shaped heart.\\nCourtesy of Dr Edward Singleton.\\nMany patients born with single-ventricle hearts (eg hypoplastic left heart syn-\\ndrome) will undergo a Fontan procedure.

As with any bedside test, \\nbe sceptical, and check \\nABGS, whenever indicated (p188).\\nArterial blood gas (ABG) analysis Heparinized blood is usually taken from the radial \\nor f\\nemoral artery (see p771). The brachial artery is used less because of median nerve \\nproximity and it is an end artery. pH, PaO2, PaCO2, HCO3 are measured using an auto-\\nmated analyser.\\nABG interpretation See pp188–9.\\nSpirometry (See table 4.1) Measures functional lung volumes.

Characteristic pat-\\nterns are seen with intra-thoracic airways obstruction (asthma, emphysema) and \\nextra-thoracic airways obstruction (tracheal stenosis).\\nRadiology Ches\\n t x-ray: See p 722. Ultrasound: Used in diagnosing and guiding \\ndr\\nainage of pleural eff usions (particularly loculated eff usions) and empyema. Ra-\\ndionuclide scans:  V entilation/perfusion ( V/Q, p738) scans are occasionally used to \\ndiagnose pulmonary embolism (PE), eg in pregnancy (unmatched perfusion defects \\nare seen). Bone scans are used to diagnose bone metastases. PET scans to assess \\ncancer and inﬂ ammation. Computed tomography: ( CT, p730) Used for diagnosing \\nand staging lung cancer, imaging the hila, mediastinum, and pleura, and guiding \\nbiopsies. Thin (\\n1–1.5mm) section high-resolution CT (HRCT) is used in the diagnosis of \\ninterstitial lung disease, emphysema, and bronchiectasis. CT pulmonary angiography \\n(CTPA) is used in the diagnosis of PE. Pulmonary angiography: Now rarely used for \\ndiagnosing pulmonary h\\nypertension.\\nFibreoptic bronchoscopy Performed under local anaesthetic via the nose or \\nmouth. Diagnostic indications: Suspected lung carcinoma, slowly resolving pneu-\\nmonia, pneumonia in the immunosuppr\\nessed, interstitial lung disease. Bronchoal-\\nveolar lavage ﬂ  uid may be sent to the lab for microscopy, culture, and cytology. \\nMucosal abnormalities may be brushed (cytology) and biopsied (histopathology). \\nTherapeutic indications: Aspiration of mucus plugs causing lobar collapse, removal \\no\\nf foreign bodies, stenting or treating tumours, eg laser. Pre-procedure investiga-\\ntions: FBC, coagulation, CXR, CT, spirometry, pulse oximetry, and ABG (if indicated). \\nComplications: Hypoxia, bleeding, pneumo thor ax (ﬁ g 16.43, p749). Diagnostic sensi-\\ntivity for cancer 50–90%, depends on tumour location; gene proﬁ ling of cell sample \\nmay improve this. 2 May also be used to deliver an ultrasound probe (endobronchial \\nultrasound), and treatments—eg stents, or cryotherapy.\\nBronchoalveolar lavage ( BAL) is performed at the time of bronchoscopy by in-\\nstilling and aspirating a known volume of warmed, buff  ered 0.9% saline into the \\ndistal airway. Diagnostic indications: Suspected malignancy, pneumonia, in the im-\\nmunosuppr\\nessed (especially HIV), bronchiectasis, suspected TB (if sputum negative), \\ninterstitial lung diseases (eg sarcoidosis, extrinsic allergic alveolitis, histiocytosis X). \\nTherapeutic indications: alveolar proteinosis. 1 Complications: Hypoxia (give sup-\\nplemental O2), transient fever, transient CXR shadow, infection (rare).\\nLung biopsy May be performed in several ways. Percutaneous needle biopsy is \\nperf\\normed under radiological guidance and is useful for peripheral lung and pleural \\nlesions. Transbronchial biopsy performed at bronchoscopy may help in diagnos-\\ning int\\nerstitial lung diseases, eg sarcoidosis, idiopathic pulmonary ﬁ brosis. Alterna-\\ntiv\\nes: If unsuccessful, consider open lung biopsy or video-assisted thoracoscopy.\\nSurgical procedures are performed under general anaesthetic. Rigid bronchos-\\ncop\\ny provides a wide lumen, enables larger mucosal biopsies, control of bleeding, \\nand r\\nemoval of foreign bodies. Mediastinoscopy and mediastinotomy enable ex-\\namination and biops\\ny of the mediastinal lymph nodes/lesions. Thoracoscopy allows \\ne\\nxamination and biopsy of pleural lesions, drainage of pleural eff  usions, and talc \\npleurodesis and pleurectomy.\\n1 Pulmonary alveolar proteinosis causes cough, dyspnoea, and restrictive spirometry. It is caused by ac-\\ncumulation of surfactant-derived acidophilic phospholipid/protein compounds which ﬁ  ll alveoli and distal \\nbronchioles. Diagnosis may require lung biopsy.

Occurs in elderly, diabetics, and alcoholics. Causes a \\nca\\nvitating pneumonia, particularly of the upper lobes, often drug resistant. Treat-\\nment: cefotaxime or imipenem.\\nPseudomonas A common pathogen in bronchiectasis and CF. It also causes \\nhospital-acquired infections, particularly on ITU or after surgery. Treatment: anti-\\npseudomonal penicillin, ceftazidime, mer\\nopenem, or ciproﬂ oxacin + aminoglycoside. \\nConsider dual therapy to minimize resistance.\\nMycoplasma pneumoniae Occurs in epidemics about every 4yrs. It presents in-\\nsidiously with ﬂ  u-like symptoms (headache, myalgia, arthralgia) followed by a dry \\ncough. \\nCXR: reticular-nodular shadowing or patchy consolidation often of one lower \\nlobe, and worse than signs suggest. Diagnosis: PCR sputum or serology. Cold aggluti-\\nnins may cause an autoimmune haemolytic anaemia. Complications: Skin rash (ery-\\nthema multif\\norme, ﬁ g 12.22, p563), Stevens–Johnson syndrome, meningo encephalitis \\nor myelitis; Guillain –Barré syndrome. Treatment: Clarithromycin ( 500mg/12h) or \\ndoxycycline (200mg loading then 100mg OD) or a ﬂ  uroquinolone (eg ciproﬂ oxacin \\nor norﬂ oxacin).\\nLegionella pneumophila Colonizes water tanks kept at <60°C (eg hotel air-con-\\nditioning and hot water systems) causing outbreaks. Flu-like symptoms (fever, \\nmalaise, myalgia) precede a dry cough and dyspnoea. Extra-pulmonary features in-\\nclude anorexia, \\nD&V, hepatitis, renal failure, confusion, and coma. CXR shows bi-basal \\nconsolidation. Blood tests may show lymphopenia, hyponatraemia, and deranged \\nLFTS. Urinalysis may show haematuria. Diagnosis: Urine antigen/culture. Treatment: \\nﬂ uor oquinolone for 2–3wks or clarithromycin (p387). 10% mortality.\\nChlamydophila pneumoniae The commonest chlamydial infection.

Type I respiratory failure (PaO2 <8kPa) is relatively \\ncommon. Treatment is with high-ﬂ ow (60%) oxygen. Transfer the patient to ITU if \\nhypoxia does not improve with O 2 therapy or PaCO2 rises to >6kPa. Be careful with \\nO2 in COPD patients; check ABGS frequently, and consider elective ventilation if rising \\nPaCO2 or worsening acidosis. Aim to keep SaO2 at 94–98%, PaO2 ≥8kPa.\\nHypotension May be due to a combination of dehydration and vasodilation due \\nt\\no sepsis. If systolic BP is <90mmHg, give an intravenous ﬂ  uid challenge of 250mL \\ncolloid/crystalloid over 15min. If BP does not rise, consider a central line and give IV \\nﬂ uids to maintain the systolic BP >90mmHg. If systolic BP remains <90mmHg despite \\nﬂ uid therapy, request ITU assessment for inotropic support.\\nAtrial ﬁ brilla tion (p130.) Common in the elderly. It usually resolves with treatment \\nof the pneumonia. \\ue020-blocker or digoxin may be required to slow the ventricular re-\\nsponse rate in the short term.\\nPleural eff usion Inﬂ ammation of the pleura by adjacent pneumonia may cause ﬂ  uid \\nexudation into the pleural space. If this accumulates faster than it is reabsorbed, a \\npleural eff usion develops. If small, it may be of no consequence. If larger and patient \\nsymptomatic, or infected (empyema), drainage is required (p\\n192, p766).\\nEmpyema Pus in the pleural space. It should be suspected if a patient with a resolv-\\ning pneumonia de\\nvelops a recurrent fever. Clinical features: CXR indicates a pleural \\neff usion. The aspirated pleural ﬂ uid is typically yellow and turbid with a pH <7.2, \\n\\ue001glucose, and \\ue000 LDH. The empyema should be drained using a chest drain, inserted \\nunder radiological guidance. Adhesions and loculation can make this diffi  cult.\\nLung abscess A cavitating area of localized, suppurative infection within the lung \\n(see ﬁ g 4.6).\\nCauses: •Inadequately treated pneumonia. •Aspiration (eg alcoholism, oesoph ageal \\nobstruction, bulb\\nar palsy). •Bronchial obstruction (tumour, foreign body). •Pulmo-\\nnary inf\\narction. •Septic emboli (septicaemia, right heart endocarditis, IV drug use). \\n•Subphrenic or hepatic abscess.\\nClinical features: Swinging fever; cough; purulent, foul-smelling sputum; pleuritic \\nchest pain; haemop\\ntysis; malaise; weight loss. Look for: ﬁ  nger clubbing; anaemia; \\ncrepitations. Empyema develops in 20–30%.\\nTests: Blood: FBC (anaemia, neutrophilia), ESR, CRP, blood cultures. Sputum micros-\\ncopy, culture, and cytology. CXR: walled cavity, often with a ﬂ  uid level. Consider CT \\nscan to exclude obstruction, and bronchoscopy to obtain diag nostic specimens.\\nTreatment: Antibiotics as indicated by sensitivities; continue until healed (4–6 wks). \\nPostural drainage. Repeated aspiration, antibiotic instillation, or surgical excision \\nmay be required.\\nSepticaemia May occur as a result of bacterial spread from the lung parenchyma \\nint\\no the bloodstream. This may cause metastatic infection, eg infective endo carditis, \\nmeningitis. Treat with IV antibiotic according to sensitivities.\\nPericarditis and myocarditis May also complicate pneumonia.\\nJaundice This is usually cholestatic, and may be due to sepsis or secondary to anti-\\nbio\\ntic therapy (particularly ﬂ  ucloxacillin and co-amoxiclav).\\n_OHCM_10e.indb   170_OHCM_10e.indb   170 02/05/2017   19:0702/05/2017   19:07'),\n",

All UK babies \\nare screened at birth. Caused by mutations in the CF transmembrane conductance \\nregulator (CFTR) gene on chromosome 7 (>1500 mutations have been identiﬁ ed). This \\nis a ClΩ channel, and the defect leads to a combination of defective chloride secretion \\nand increased sodium absorption across airway epithelium. The changes in the com-\\nposition of airway surface liquid predispose the lung to chronic pulmonary infections \\nand bronchiectasis. See \\nOHCS (‘Paediatrics’, p162) for more detail.\\nClinical features Neonate: F ailure to thrive; meconium ileus; rectal prolapse.\\nChildren and young adults: R espiratory: cough; wheeze; recurrent infections; \\nbronchiectasis; pneumothorax; haemoptysis; respiratory failure; cor pulmonale. \\nGastrointestinal: pancreatic insuffi   ciency (diabetes mellitus, steatorrhoea); distal \\nintestinal obstruction syndrome (meconium ileus equivalent); gallstones; cirrhosis. \\nOther: male infertility; osteoporosis; arthritis; vasculitis (p\\n556); nasal polyps; sinusi-\\ntis; and hypertrophic pulmonary osteoarthropathy ( HPOA). Signs: cyanosis; ﬁ nger \\nclubbing; bilateral coarse crackles.\\nDiagnosis Sweat test: Sweat sodium and chloride >60mmol/L; chloride usu-\\nally > sodium.

Symptoms: wheeze, cough, sputum \\n(plugs of mucus containing fungal hyphae, see p 408), dyspnoea, and ‘recurrent \\npneumonia’. Investigations:  CXR (transient segmental collapse or consolida-\\ntion, bronchiectasis); Aspergillus  in sputum; positive Aspergillus  skin test and/\\nor Aspergillus -speciﬁ c IgE RAST (radioallergosorbent test); positive serum pre-\\ncipitins; eosinophilia; raised serum IgE. Treatment: prednisolone 30–40mg/24h \\nPO for acute attacks; maintenance dose 5–10mg/d. Itraconazole can be used in \\ncombination with corticosteroids. Bronchodilators for asthma. Sometimes bron-\\nchoscopic aspiration of mucus plugs is needed.\\n3       Aspergilloma (mycetoma): A fungus ball within a pre-existing cavity (often \\ncaused by TB or sarcoidosis).

Investigations:  CXR \\n(round opacity within a cavity, usually apical); sputum culture; strongly posi-\\ntive serum precipitins; Aspergillus  skin test (30% +ve). Treatment (only if symp-\\ntomatic): consider surgical excision for solitary symptomatic lesions or severe \\nhaemoptysis. Oral itraconazole and other antifungals have been tried with lim-\\nited success.

Rescue \\ncourses of prednisolone may be used at any time. For drug examples see table 4.6.\\n  • Step 1: Occasional short-acting inhaled \\ue0202-agonist as required for symptom relief. \\nIf used more than once daily, or night-time symptoms, go to Step 2.\\n  • St ep 2: Add standard-dose inhaled steroid, eg beclometasone 200–800mcg/day, or \\nstart at the dose appropriate for disease severity, and titrate as required.\\n  • St ep 3: Add long-acting \\ue0202-agonist (eg salmeterol 50mcg/12h by inhaler). If bene-\\nﬁ t—but still inadequate control—continue and \\ue000dose of beclometasone to 800mcg/\\nday. If no eff ect then stop LABA and \\ue000dose of beclometasone to 800mcg/day. Leu-\\nkotriene receptor antagonist or oral theophylline may be tried.\\n  • St ep 4: Consider trials of: beclometasone up to 2000mcg/day; modiﬁ ed-release oral \\ntheophylline; modiﬁ ed-release oral \\ue0202-agonist tablets; oral leukotriene receptor an-\\ntagonist, in conjunction with previous therapy.\\n  • St ep 5: Add regular oral prednisolone (1 dose daily, at the lowest possible dose). \\nContinue with high-dose inhaled steroids. Refer for specialist input.\\nDrugs \\ue0582-adrenoceptor agonists: R elax bronchial smooth muscle (\\ue000 CAMP), acting \\nwithin minutes. Salbutamol is best given by inhalation (aerosol, powder, nebulizer), \\nbut may also be given \\nPO or IV. SE: tachyarrhythmias, \\ue001K+, tremor, anxiety. Long-act-\\ning inhaled \\ue0202-agonist (eg salmeterol, formoterol) can help nocturnal symptoms and \\nreduce morning dips. They may be an alternative to \\ue000steroid dose when symptoms \\nare uncontrolled; doubts remain over whether they are associated with an increase \\nin adverse events.\\n 34 SE: as salbutamol, paradoxical bronchospasm. 35\\nCorticosteroids: Best inhaled to minimize systemic eff  ects, eg beclometasone via \\nspacer (or po\\nwder), but may be given PO or IV. They act over days to \\ue001bronchial mu-\\ncosal inﬂ ammation. Rinse mouth after inhaled steroids to prevent oral candidiasis. \\nOral steroids are used acutely (high-dose, short courses, eg prednisolone 40mg/24h \\nPO for 7d) and longer term in lower dose (eg 5–10mg/24h) if control is not optimal on \\ninhalers. Warn about SEs: p377.\\nAminophylline: (Metabolized to theophylline) acts by inhibiting phospho diest erase, \\nthus \\ue001bronchoconstriction by \\ue000CAMP levels. Try as prophylaxis, at night, PO, to prevent \\nmorning dipping. Stick with one brand name (bioavailability variable). Also useful \\nas an adjunct if inhaled therapy is inadequate. In acute severe asthma, it may be \\ngiven \\nIVI. It has a narrow therapeutic ratio, causing arrhythmias, GI upset, and ﬁ ts \\nin the toxic range. Check theophylline levels (p756), and do ECG monitoring and check \\nplasma levels after 24h if IV therapy is used.\\nAnticholinergics: (Eg ipratropium, tiotropium.) May \\ue001muscle spasm s ynergistically \\nwith \\ue0202-agonists but are not recommended in current guidelines for chronic asthma. \\nThey may be of more beneﬁ t in COPD.\\nCromoglicate (Mast cell stabilizer.) May be used as prophylaxis in mild and exercise-\\ninduced asthma (alw\\nays inhaled), especially in children. It may precipitate asthma.\\nLeukotriene receptor antagonists: (Eg oral montelukast, zaﬁ  rlukast.) Block the ef-\\nfects of cysteinyl leukotrienes in the airways by antagonizing the CystLT1 receptor.\\nAnti-IgE monoclonal antibody: Omalizumab  36 may be of use in highly selected \\npatients with persistent allergic asthma.

It includes chronic bronchitis and emphysema. Usually patients have \\neither COPD or asthma, not both: COPD is favoured by: •age of onset >35yrs •smok-\\ning (passiv\\ne or active) or pollution related38 •chronic dyspnoea •sputum production \\n•minimal diurnal or day-to-day FEV1 variat ion. Chronic bronchitis is deﬁ  ned clini-\\ncally as cough, sputum pr\\noduction on most days for 3 months of 2 successive yrs. \\nSymptoms improve if they stop smoking. There is no excess mortality if lung func-\\ntion is normal. Emphysema is deﬁ ned hist\\n ologically  as enlarged air spaces distal to \\nterminal bronchioles, with destruction of alveolar walls but often visualized on CT.\\nPrevalence 10–20% of the over-40s; 2.5≈106 deaths/yr worldwide. 39\\nPink puff ers and blue bloaters  A traditional division but likely ends of a spec-\\ntrum. Pink puffers: Ha ve \\ue000alveolar ventilation, a near normal PaO2 and a normal or \\nlow PaCO2. They are breathless but are not cyanosed. They may progress to type I \\nrespiratory failure (p188). Blue bloaters: Have \\ue001alv eolar ventilation, with a low PaO2 \\nand a high PaCO2. They are cyanosed but not breathless and may go on to develop \\ncor pulmonale. Their respiratory centres are relatively insensitive to CO 2 and they \\nrely on hypoxic drive to maintain respiratory eff ort (p188)—\\ue007supplemental oxygen \\nshould be giv\\nen with care.\\nSymptoms Cough; sputum; dyspnoea; wheeze.

Pulmonary artery \\ncatheter to measure pulmonary capillary wedge pressure (PCWP).\\nDiagnostic criteria One consensus requires these four to exist: 45 1 Acute onset. \\n2 CXR: bilateral inﬁ ltrates (ﬁ g 4.15). 3 PCWP <19mmHg or a lack of clinical congestive \\nheart failure. 4 Refractory hypoxaemia with PaO2: FiO2 <200 for ARDS. Others include \\ntotal thoracic compliance <30mL/cmH2O.\\nManagement Admit to ITU; give supportive therapy; treat the under lying cause.\\n  • R espiratory support: In early ARDS, continuous positive airway pressure ( CPAP) \\nwith 40–60% oxygen may be adequate to maintain oxygenation. But most patients \\nneed mechanical ventilation. Indications for ventilation: PaO2: <8.3kPa despite 60% \\nO2; PaCO2: >6kPa. The large tidal volumes (10–15mL/kg) produced by conventional \\nventilation plus reduced lung compliance in ARDS may lead to high peak airway pres-\\nsures ± pneumothorax. A low-tidal-volume, pressure-limited approach, with either \\nlow or moderate high positive end-expiratory pressure (PEEP), improves outcome.\\n  • Cir culatory support: In vasive haemodynamic monitoring with an arterial line and \\nSwan–Ganz catheter aids the diagnosis and may be helpful in monitoring PCWP and \\ncardiac output. A conservative ﬂ uid management approach improves outcome. \\nMaintain cardiac output and O2 delivery with inotropes (eg dobutamine 2.5–10mcg/\\nkg/min IVI), vasodilators, and blood transfusion. Consider treating pulmonary hyper-\\ntension with low-dose (20–120 parts per million) nitric oxide, a pulmonary vasodila-\\ntor. Haemo ﬁ ltration may be needed in renal failure and to achieve a negative ﬂ uid \\nbalance. 46, 49\\n  • Sepsis: I dentify organism(s) and treat. If septic, but no organisms cultured, use \\nempirical broad-spectrum antibiotics (p167). Avoid nephrotoxic antibiotics.\\n  • Other: Nutritional support: ent eral is best: p584 & p586, with high-fat, antioxidant \\nformulations. Steroids protect those at risk of fat embolization and with pneumo-\\ncystosis and may improve outcome in subacute \\nARDS. Their role in established ARDS \\nis controversial. 50, 51\\nPrognosis Overall mortality is 50–75%. Prognosis varies with age of patient, cause \\n(pneumonia 86%, trauma 38%), and number of organs involved (three organs in-\\nvolved for >1wk is ‘invariably’ fatal).\\n_OHCM_10e.indb   186_OHCM_10e.indb   186 02/05/2017   19:0702/05/2017   19:07'),\n",

Symptoms: Acute breathlessness, pleuritic chest pain, haemoptysis; diz-\\nziness; s\\nyncope. Ask about risk factors, past history or family history of thromboem-\\nbolism. Signs: Pyrexia; cyanosis; tachypnoea; tachycardia; hypotension; raised JVP; \\npleural rub; pleural eff  usion. Look for signs of a cause, eg deep vein thrombosis.\\nTests\\n  • FBC, U&E, baseline clotting, D-dimers (BOX).\\n  • ABG may show \\ue001PaO2 and \\ue001PaCO2.\\n  • Imaging: CXR may be normal, or show oligaemia of aff ected segment, dilated pul-\\nmonary artery, linear atelectasis, small pleural eff usion, wedge-shaped opacities or \\ncavitation (rare). CTPA—see ﬁ g 4.16.\\n  • ECG may be normal, or show tachycardia, right bundle branch block, right vent-\\nricular strain (inverted T in V1 to V4). The classical SI QIII TIII pattern (p98) is rare.\\n\\ue007Further investigations are shown on p818.\\nTreatment \\ue022See p818. If haemodynamically unstable, thrombolyse for massive \\nPE (alteplase 10mg IV over 1min, then 90mg IVI over 2h; max 1 . 5mg/kg if <65kg). \\nHaemodynamically stable: start LMWH or unfractionated heparin if underlying renal \\nimpairment and treat for 5 days. Then, start DOAC (direct oral anticoagulant) or war-\\nfarin (p350). For warfarin, stop heparin when INR is 2–3, due to intial prothrombotic \\neff ect of warfarin (target INR of 2–3). Consider placement of a vena caval ﬁ lter if \\ncontra-indication to anticoagulation.\\nUnprovoked PE In patients with no known provoking risk factors, consider inves-\\ntigation f\\nor possible underlying malignany. Undertake full history, examination \\n(including breast), CXR, FBC, calcium, LFTS, urinalysis. Patients >40yrs consider abdo-\\npelvic CT and mammography in women. Consider antiphospholipid and thrombo-\\nphilia testing if family history positive (p374).\\nPrevention Give heparin to all immobile patients. Stop HRT and the combined con-\\ntraceptive pill pre-op (if reliable with another form of contraception).\\nPneumothorax\\nCaus  es Often spontaneous (especially in young, thin men) due to rupture of a sub-\\npleur\\nal bulla.

Eff  usions can be divided \\nby their protein concentration into transudates (<25g/L) and exudates (>35g/L), see \\nBOX. Blood in the pleural space is a haemothorax, pus in the pleural space is an em-\\npyema, and chyle (lymph with fat) is a chylothorax. Both blood and air in the pleural \\nspace is called a haemopneumothorax.\\nCauses Transudates ma y be due to \\ue000 venous pressure (cardiac failure, constrictive \\npericarditis, ﬂ  uid overload), or hypoproteinaemia (cirrhosis, nephrotic syndrome, mal-\\nabsorption). Also occur in hypothyroidism and Meigs’ syndrome (right pleural eff usion \\nand ovarian ﬁ broma). Exudates are mostly due to increased leakiness of pleural cap-\\nillaries secondary t\\no infection, inﬂ  ammation, or malignancy. Causes: pneumonia; TB; \\npulmonary infarction; rheumatoid arthritis; SLE; bronchogenic carcin oma; malignant \\nmetastases; lymphoma; mesothelioma; lymphangitis carcinomatosis.\\nSymptoms Asymptomatic—or dyspnoea, pleuritic chest pain.\\nSigns Decr eased expansion; stony dull percussion note; diminished breath sounds  \\noccur on the aff  ected side. Tactile vocal fremitus and vocal resonance are \\ue001 (incon-\\nstant and unreliable). Above the eff usion, where lung is compressed, there may be \\nbronchial breathing. With large eff  usions there may be tracheal deviation away \\nfrom the eff usion. Look for aspiration marks and signs of associated disease: ma-\\nlignancy (cachexia, clubbing, lymphadenopathy, radiation marks, mastectomy scar); \\nstigmata of chronic liver disease; cardiac failure; hypothyroidism; rheumatoid arthri-\\ntis; butterﬂ  y rash of \\nSLE.\\nTests CXR: Small eff  usions blunt the costophrenic angles, larger ones are seen as \\nwater-dense shadows with concave upper borders. A completely ﬂ at horizontal up-\\nper border implies that there is also a pneumothorax.\\nUltrasound is useful in identifying the presence of pleural ﬂ  uid and in guiding diag-\\nnostic or therapeutic aspiration.\\nDiagnostic aspiration: Percuss the upper border of the pleural eff  usion and choose \\na site 1 or 2 intercostal spaces below it (don’t go too low or you’ll be in the abdo-\\nmen!). Inﬁ ltrate down to the pleura with 5–10mL of 1% lidocaine. Attach a 21G needle \\nto a syringe and insert it just above the upper border of an appropriate rib (avoids \\nneurovascular bundle). Draw off  \\n10–30mL of pleural ﬂ uid and send it to the lab for \\nclinical chemistry (protein, glucose, pH, LDH, amylase), bacteriology (microscopy \\nand culture, auramine stain, TB culture), cytology, and, if indicated, immunology  \\n(rheumatoid factor, ANA, complement). See table 4.9.\\nPleural biopsy: If pleural ﬂ  uid analysis is inconclusive, consider parietal pleural biopsy. \\nThoracoscopic or CT-guided pleural biopsy increases diagnostic yield (by enabling \\ndirect visualization of the pleural cavity and biopsy of suspicious areas).\\nManagement is of the underlying cause.\\n  • Dr ainage: I f the eff  usion is symptomatic, drain it, repeatedly if necessary. Fluid \\nis best removed slowly ( 0.5–1.5L/24h). It may be aspirated in the same way as a \\ndiagnostic tap, or using an intercostal drain (see p766).\\n  • P leurodesis with talc may be helpful for recurrent eff usions. Thorascopic mechani-\\ncal pleurodesis is most eff ective for malignant eff  usions.

Prevalence highest in \\nNorthern Europe, eg UK: 10–20/105 population. Usually aff ects adults aged 20–40yrs, \\nmore common in women. African –Caribbeans are aff ected more frequently and \\nmore severely than Caucasians, particularly by extra-thoracic disease. Associated \\nwith \\nHLA-DRB1 and DQB1 alleles. For other causes of granuloma see table 4.10.\\nClinical features In 20–40%, the disease is discovered incidentally, after a routine \\nCXR, and is thus asymptomatic. Acute sarcoidosis often presents with fever, erythe-\\nma nodosum (ﬁ g 12.21, p563),6 polyarthralgia, and bilateral hilar lymphodenopathy \\n(BHL), also called Löfgren syndrome, which usually resolves spontaneously.\\nPulmonary disease:  90% have abnormal CXRs with BHL (ﬁ g 4.18) ± pulmonary inﬁ l-\\ntrates or ﬁ brosis; see later in topic for staging. Symptoms: Dry cough, progressive \\ndyspnoea, \\ue001exercise tolerance, and chest pain.

Stage 4: progressive pulmonary ﬁ brosis; bulla formation (honey-\\ncombing); pleural involvement. ECG may show arrhythmias or bundle branch block. \\nLung function tests may be normal or show reduced lung volumes, impaired gas \\ntr\\nansfer, and a restrictive ventilatory defect. Tissue biopsy (lung, liv er, lymph nodes, \\nskin nodules, or lacrimal glands) is diagnostic and shows non-caseating granulo-\\nmata.\\nBronchoalveolar lavage (\\nBAL): Shows \\ue000lymphocy tes in active disease; \\ue000neutrophils \\nwith pulmonary ﬁ brosis. Transbrochial biopsy: May be diagnostic.\\nUltrasound: May show nephrocalcinosis or hepatosplenomegaly.\\nBone X-rays: Show ‘punched out’ lesions in terminal phalanges.\\nCT/MRI: May be useful in assessing severity of pulmonary disease or diagnosing \\nneur\\nosarcoidosis. Ophthalmology assessment  (slit lamp examination, ﬂ uorescein \\nangiography) is indicated in ocular disease.\\nManagement \\ue007Patients with BHL alone don’t need treatment as most recover spon-\\ntaneously.53, 54 Acute sarcoidosis: bed rest, NSAIDS.\\nIndications for corticosteroids:\\n  • Parenchymal lung disease (symptomatic, static, or progressive).\\n  • Uveitis.\\n  • Hypercalcaemia.\\n  • Neurological or cardiac involvement.\\nP\\nrednisolone (40mg/24h) PO for 4–6 wks, then \\ue001dose over 1yr according to clinical \\nstatus.

In the acute phase, the alveoli are inﬁ ltrated \\nwith acute inﬂ ammatory cells. Early diagnosis and prompt allergen removal can halt \\nand reverse disease progression, so prognosis can be good. With chronic exposure, \\ngranuloma formation and obliterative bronchiolitis occur.\\nCauses\\n  • Bird-fancier’s and pigeon-fancier’s lung (proteins in bird droppings).\\n  • Farmer’s and mushroom worker’s lung (Micr\\n opolyspora faeni, Thermoactino-\\nmyces vulgaris ).\\n  • Malt worker’s lung (Asper gillus clavatus ).\\n  • Bagassosis or sugar worker’s lung (T hermoactinomyces sacchari ).\\nClinical features 4–6h post-exposure: Fever, rigors, myalgia, dry cough, dyspnoea, \\nﬁ \\nne bibasal crackles. Chronic: Finger clubbing (50%), increasing dyspnoea, \\ue001weight, \\nexertional dyspnoea, type I respiratory failure, cor pulmonale.\\nTests Acute: Blood: FBC (neutrophilia); \\ue000ESR; ABGS; serum antibodies (may indicate \\nexposure/previous sensitization rather than disease). CXR: upper-zone mottling/con-\\nsolidation; hilar lymph adenopathy (rare). Lung function tests: Reversible restrictive \\ndefect; reduced gas transfer during acute attacks. Chronic: Blood tests: serum anti-\\nbodies. CXR: upper-zone ﬁ  brosis; honeycomb lung. CT chest: nodules, ground glass ap-\\npearance, extensive ﬁ brosis. Lung function tests: restrictive defect.

Deﬁ  ne clinical syndromes \\nassociated with too much or too little secretion ( hyper- and hypo-syndromes, \\nrespectively; eu- means normal, neither \\ue000 nor \\ue001, as in euthyroid). Note factors that \\nmay make measurement variable, eg diurnal release of cortisol.\\n  • If suspecting hormone deﬁ ciency, test by stimulating the gland that produces it \\n(eg short ACTH stimulation test or Synacthen® test in Addison’s). If the gland is \\nnot functioning normally, there will be a blunted response to stimulation.\\n  • If suspecting hormone excess, test by inhibiting the gland that produces it (eg \\ndexamethasone suppression test in Cushing’s). If there is a hormone-secreting \\ntumour then this will fail to suppress via normal feedback mechanisms.\\n  • Find a way to image the gland. NB: non-functioning tumours or ‘incidentalomas’ \\nmay be found in health, see p224. Imaging alone does not make the diagnosis.\\n  • Aim to halt disease progression; diet and exercise can stop progression of im-\\npaired fasting glucose to frank diabetes. 1, 2 For other glands, halting progression \\nwill depend on understanding autoimmunity, and the interaction of genes and \\nenvironment. In thyroid autoimmunity (an archetypal autoimmune disease), it \\nis possible to track interactions between genes and environment (eg smoking \\nand stress) via expression of immuno logically active molecules (HLA class I and \\nII, adhesion molecules, cytokines, CD40, and complement regulatory proteins). 3\\nEndocrinologists love this reductionist approach, but have been less successful \\nat understanding emergent phenomena—those properties and performances of \\nours that cannot be predicted from full knowledge of our perturbed parts.  We \\nunderstand the diurnal nature of cortisol secretion, for example, but the science \\nof relating this to dreams, the consolidation of memory, and the psychopathology \\nof families and other groups (such as the endocrinology ward round you may be \\nabout to join) is in its infancy.  But as doctors we are steeped in the hormonal lives \\nof patients (as they are in ours)—and we may as well start by recognizing this now.\\nFor those doing exams\\n‘What’s wrong with him?’ your examiner asks, boldly. While you apologize to \\nthe patient for this rudeness by asking, ‘Is it alright if we speak about you as if \\nyou weren’t here?’, think to yourself that if you were a betting man or woman \\nyou would wager that the diagnosis will be endocrinological. In no other disci-\\npline are gestalt impressions so characteristic. To get good at recognizing these \\nconditions, spend time in endocrinology outpatients and looking at collections \\nof clinical photographs. Also, speciﬁ c cutaneous signs are important, as follows.\\nThyrotoxicosis: Hair loss; pretibial myxoedema (confusing term, p 218); onycho-\\nlysis (nail separation from the nailbed); bulging eyes (exophthalmos/proptosis).\\nHypothyroidism:  Hair loss; eyebrow loss; cold, pale skin; characteristic face.

Hyperglycae-\\nmia is one aspect of a far-reaching metabolic derangement, which causes serious \\nmicrovascular (retinopathy, nephropathy, neuropathy) or macrovascular problems: \\nstroke, \\nMI, renovascular disease, limb ischaemia. So think of DM as a vascular dis-\\nease:1 adopt a holistic approach and consider other cardiovascular risk factors too.\\nCategories of diabetes and dyslipidaemia\\nT\\nype 1 DM: Usually adolescent onset but may occur at any age. Cause: insulin de-\\nﬁ ciency from autoimmune destruction of insulin-secreting pancreatic \\ue020 cells. Pa-\\ntients must have insulin, and are prone to ketoacidosis and weight loss. Associated \\nwith other autoimmune diseases (>90% HLA DR3 ± DR4). Concordance is only ~30% in \\nidentical twins, indic ating environmental inﬂ uence. Four genes are important: one \\n(6q) determines islet sensitivity to damage (eg from viruses or cross-reactivity from \\ncows’ milk-induced antibodies). Latent autoimmune diabetes of adults ( LADA) is a \\nform of type 1 DM, with slower progression to insulin dependence in later life.\\nType 2 DM: (Formerly non-insulin-dependent DM, NIDDM) is at ‘epidemic’ levels in many \\nplaces, mainly due to changes in lifestyle, but also because of better diagnosis and \\nimproved long evity.\\n4 Higher prevalence in Asians, men, and the elderly (up to 18%).   \\nMost are over 40yrs, but teenagers are now getting type 2 DM (OHCS p156). Cause: \\n\\ue001insulin secretion ± \\ue000insulin resistance. It is associated with obesity, lack of exercise, \\ncalorie and alcohol excess. \\ue00680% concordance in identical twins, indicating stronger \\ngenetic inﬂ uence than in type 1 DM. Typically progresses from a preliminary phase of \\nimpaired glucose tolerance (IGT) or impaired fasting glucose (IFG). (\\ue007This is a unique \\nwindo\\nw for lifestyle intervention.) Maturity   onset diabetes of the young (MODY) is a \\nrare autosomal dominant form of type 2 DM aff  ecting young people.\\nImpaired glucose tolerance ( IGT): Fasting plasma glucose <7mmol/L and OGTT (oral \\nglucose tolerance) 2h glucose ≥7.8mmol/L but <11.1mmol/L.\\nImpaired fasting glucose ( IFG): Fasting plasma glucose ≥ 6.1mmol/L but <7mmol/L \\n(WHO criteria). Do an OGTT to exclude DM. The cut-off  point is somewhat arbitrary.\\nIGT and IFG denote diff erent abnormalities of glucose regulation (post-prandial and \\nfasting). There may be lower risk of progression to DM in IFG than IGT. Manage both \\nwith lifestyle advice (p93) + annual review. Incidence of DM if IFG and HbA1C at high \\nend of normal (37–46mmol/mol) is ~25%.5\\nOther causes of DM \\ue007Steroids; anti-HIV drugs; newer antipsychotics.  \\n  • Pancreatic: pancr eatitis; surgery (where >90% pancreas is removed); trauma; \\npancreatic destruction (haemochromatosis, cystic ﬁ brosis); pancreatic cancer.\\n  • Cushing’s disease; acromegaly; phaeochromocytoma; hyperthyroidism; pregnancy.\\n  • Others: congenital lipody strophy; glycogen storage diseases.\\nMetabolic syndrome (syndrome x) Deﬁ nition from International Diabetes Federa-\\ntion: central obesity (BMI >30, or \\ue000 waist circ, ethnic-speciﬁ c values), plus two of BP ≥130/85, \\ntriglycerides ≥1.7mmol/L, HDL ≤ 1.03\\ue032/1.29\\ue033mmol/L, fasting glucose ≥ 5.6mmol/L or  \\ntype 2 DM. ~20% are aff  ected; weight, genetics, and insulin resistance important in aetiol-\\nogy.

The thyroid produces mainly T4, which is 5-fold less \\nactive than T3. 85% of T3 is formed from peripheral conversion of T4. Most T3 and T4 \\nin plasma is protein bound, eg to thyroxine-binding globulin (TBG). The unbound por-\\ntion is the active part. T3 and T4 \\ue000cell metabolism, via nuclear receptors, and are thus \\nvital for growth and mental development. They also \\ue000catecholamine eff ects. Thyroid \\nhormone abnormalities are usually due to problems in the thyroid gland itself, and \\nrarely caused by the hypothalamus or the anterior pituitary.\\nBasic tests See table 5.2. Free T4 and T3 are more useful than total T4 and T3 as the \\nlatter are aff ected by TBG. Total T4 and T3 are \\ue000 when TBG is \\ue000 and vice versa . TBG is \\ue000 \\nin pregnancy, oestrogen therapy (HRT, oral contraceptives), and hepatitis. TBG is \\ue001 in \\nnephrotic syndrome and malnutrition (both from protein loss), drugs (androgens, \\ncortico steroids, phenytoin), chronic liver disease, and acromegaly. TSH is very useful:\\n  • Hyperthyroidism suspected:  Ask for T3, T4, and TSH. All will have \\ue001TSH (except the \\nrare TSH-secreting pituitary adenoma). Most have \\ue000T4, but ~1% have only raised T3.\\n  • Hypothyroidism suspected or monitoring replacement \\ue057: Ask for only T4 and \\nTSH. T3 does not add any extra information. TSH varies through the day: trough at \\n2PM; 30% higher during darkness, so during monitoring, try to do at the same time.\\nSick euthyroidism:  In any systemic illness, TFTS may become deranged. The typical \\npattern is for ‘everything to be low’. The test should be repeated after recovery.\\nAssay interference  is caused by antibodies in the serum, interfering with the test.\\nOther tests\\n  • Thyroid autoantibodies: Antithyroid peroxidase (TPO; formerly called microsomal) \\nantibodies or antithyro globulin antibodies may be increased in autoimmune thy-\\nroid disease: Hashimoto’s or Graves’ disease. If +ve in Graves’, there is an increased \\nrisk of developing hypothyroidism at a later stage.\\n  • TSH receptor antibody: May be \\ue000 in Graves’ disease (useful in pregnancy).\\n  • Serum thyroglobulin:  Useful in monitoring the treatment of carcinoma (p600), and \\nin detection of factitious (self-medicated) hyperthyroidism, where it is low.\\n  • Ultrasound: This distinguishes cystic (usually, but not always, benign) from solid \\n(possibly malignant) nodules. If a solitary (or dominant) large nodule, in a multi nod-\\nular goitre, do a ﬁ ne-needle aspiration to look for thyroid cancer; see ﬁ g 13.23, p601.\\n  • Isotope scan: (123Iodine, 99technetium pertechnetate, etc; see ﬁ g 13.22, p601.) Useful \\nfor determining the cause of hyperthyroidism and to detect retrosternal goitre, ec-\\ntopic thyroid tissue or thyroid metastases (+ whole body CT). If there are suspicious \\nnodules, the question is: does the area have increased (hot), decreased (cold), or the \\nsame (neutral) uptake of isotope as the remaining thyroid (see ﬁ g 5.13). Few neu-\\ntral and almost no hot nodules are malignant. 20% of ‘cold’ nodules are malignant. \\nSurgery is most likely to be needed if: •rapid growth •compression signs •dominant \\nnodule on scintigraphy •nodule \\ue0063cm •hypo-echogenicity.

The main known risk factor is \\nsmoking. The eye disease may not correlate with thyroid disease and the patient \\ncan be euthyroid, hypothyroid, or hyperthyroid at presentation. Eye disease may \\nbe the ﬁ rst presenting sign of Graves’ disease, and can also be worsened by treat-\\nment, typically with radioiodine (usually a transient eff ect). Retro-orbital inﬂ am-\\nmation and lymphocyte inﬁ ltration results in swelling of the orbit.\\nSymptoms Eye discomfort, grittiness, \\ue000tear production, photophobia, diplopia, \\n\\ue001acuity, aff  erent pupillary defect (p72) may mean optic nerve compression: \\ue007Seek \\nexpert advice at once as decompression may be needed . Nerve damage does not \\nnecessarily go hand-in-hand with protrusion. Indeed, if the eye cannot protrude \\nfor anatomical reasons, optic nerve compression is more likely—a paradox!\\nSigns Exophthalmos—appearance of protruding eye; proptosis —eyes protrude \\nbeyond the orbit (look from above in the same plane as the forehead); conjunctival \\noedema; corneal ulceration; papilloedema; loss of colour vision. Ophth almoplegia \\n(especially of upward gaze) occurs due to muscle swelling and ﬁ brosis.\\nTests Diagnosis is clinical. CT/MRI of the orbits may reveal enlarged eye muscles.\\nManagement Get specialist help. Treat hyper- or hypothyroidism. Advise to stop \\nsmoking (worse prognosis).  Most have mild disease that can be treated sympto-\\nmatically (artiﬁ cial tears, sunglasses, avoid dust, elevate bed when sleeping to \\n\\ue001periorbital oedema). Diplopia may be managed with a Fresnel prism stuck to one \\nlens of a spectacle (aids easy changing as the exophthalmos changes). In more se-\\nvere disease, try high-dose steroids (IV methylprednisolone is better than predniso-\\nlone 100mg/day PO)18—decreasing according to symptoms. Surgical decomp ression \\nis used for severe sight-threatening disease, or for cosmetic reasons once the activ-\\nity of eye disease has reduced (via an inferior orbital approach, using space in the \\nethmoidal, sphenoidal, and maxillary sinuses).

Destruction of the adrenal cortex leads to glucocorticoid (cortisol) \\nand mineralocorticoid (aldosterone) deﬁ ciency (see ﬁ g 5.21). Signs are capricious: \\nit is ‘the unforgiving master of non-speciﬁ  city and disguise ’.23 You may diagnose \\na viral infection or anorexia nervosa in error (K+ is \\ue001 in the latter but \\ue000 in Addison’s).\\nPhysiology:\\nCauses: 80% are due to autoimmunity in the UK. Other causes: TB (commonest cause \\nworldwide), adrenal metastases (eg from lung, breast, renal cancer), lymphoma,  op-\\nportunistic infections in HIV (eg CMV, Mycobacterium avium , p400); adrenal haem-\\norrhage ( \\ue022Waterhouse–Friderichsen syndrome p 714; antiphospho lipid syndrome; \\nSLE),  congenital (late-onset congenital adrenal hyperplasia).\\nSecondary adrenal insuffi  ciency The commonest cause is iatrogenic, due to long-\\nterm steroid therapy leading to suppression of the pituitary–adrenal axis. This only \\nbecomes apparent on withdrawal of the steroids. Other causes are rare and include \\nhypothalamic–pituitary disease leading to \\ue001ACTH production. Mineralocorticoid pro-\\nduction remains intact, and there is no hyperpigmentation as \\ue001ACTH.\\nSymptoms Often diagnosed late: lean, tanned, tired, tearful ± weakness, anorexia, \\ndizzy, faints, ﬂ u-like myalgias/arthralgias.

They \\nare aff  ected in this order: growth hormone (GH), gonadotropins: follicle-stimulating \\nhormone (FSH) and luteinizing hormone (LH), thyroid-stimulating hormone (TSH), and \\nadreno corticotrophic hormone (ACTH), prolactin (PRL). Panhypo pituitarism is deﬁ cien-\\ncy of all anterior hormones, usually caused by irradiation, surgery, or pituitary tumour.\\nCauses are at three levels. 1 Hypothalamus: Kallman’s syndrome (p 231), tumour, \\ninﬂ am mation, infection (meningitis, TB), ischaemia. 2 Pituitary stalk: Trauma, sur-\\ngery\\n, mass lesion (craniopharyngioma, p234), meningioma, carotid artery aneurysm. \\n3 Pituitary: Tumour, irradiation, inﬂ ammation, autoimmunity,7 inﬁ ltration (haemo-\\nchromatosis, amy loid, metastases), ischaemia (pituitary apoplexy, p234; DIC 8; Shee-\\nhan’s syndrome9).\\nFeatures are due to:\\n1 Hormone lack: •GH: central obesity, atherosclerosis, dry wrinkly skin, \\ue001strength, \\n\\ue001bala nce, \\ue001well-being, \\ue001exercise ability, \\ue001cardiac output, osteoporosis, \\ue001glucose.  \\n•Gonadotropin ( FSH; LH): \\ue033 oligomenorrhoea or amenorrhoea, \\ue001f ertility, \\ue001libido, os-\\nteoporosis, breast atrophy, dyspareunia. \\ue032 Erectile dysfunction, \\ue001libido, \\ue001muscle bulk, \\nh\\nypogonadism (\\ue001hair, all over; small testes; \\ue001ejaculate volume; \\ue001spermatogenesis). \\n•Thyroid: as f or hypothyroidism (p220). •Corticotropin: as f or adrenal insuffi  ciency \\n(p226).

Also do U&E (\\ue001Na+from dilution), \\ue001Hb (normochromic, normocytic).\\n  • D ynamic tests: 1 Short Synacthen® test: (p 226) to assess the adrenal axis.   \\n2 Insulin tolerance test (ITT): done in specialist centres to assess the adrenal and GH \\naxes. CI: epilepsy, heart disease, adrenal failure. Consult lab ﬁ rst. It involves IV insu-\\nlin to induce hypoglycaemia, causing stress to \\ue000cortisol and GH secretion. It is done \\nin the morning (water only taken from 22:00h the night before). Have 50% glucose \\nand hydrocortisone to hand and IV access. Glucose must fall below 2.2mmol/L and \\nthe patient should bec ome symptomatic when cortisol and GH are taken. Normal: \\nGH >20mU/L, and peak cortisol >550nmol/L.\\n3 Arginine + growth hormone-releasing hormone test.\\n4 Glucagon stimulation test is alternative when ITT is contraindicated.\\n  • In vestigate cause:  MRI scan to look for a hypothalamic or pituitary lesion.\\nTreatment Refer to an endocrinologist for assessment of pituitary fuction and to \\no\\nversee hormone replacement and treatment of underlying cause.\\n  • Hy drocortisone  for 2° adrenal failure (p226) \\ue007before other hormones are given.\\n  • Thyroxine if hypothyroid (p220, but TSH is useless for monitoring).\\n  • Hypogonadism (for symptoms and to prevent osteoporosis). \\ue032: op tions include \\ntestosterone enan thate 250mg IM every 3 weeks , daily topical gels or buccal \\nmuco  adhesive tablets.

They may be divided by size: a microadenoma is a tumour \\n<1cm across, and a macroadenoma is >1cm. There are three histological types (table 5.4):\\n1       Chr omophobe 70%. Many are non-secretory,10 some cause hypopituitarism. Half \\nproduce prolactin (PRL); a few produce ACTH or GH. Local pressure eff ect in 30%.\\n2       A cidophil 15%. Secrete GH or PRL. Local pressure eff ect in 10%.\\n3       Basophil 15%. Secrete ACTH. Local pressure eff ect rare.\\nSymptoms are caused by pressure, hormones (eg galactorrhoea), or hypopituitarism \\n(p232). FSH-secreting tumours can cause macro-orchidism in men, but are rare.\\nFeatures of local pressure Headache, visual ﬁ eld defects (bilateral temporal hemi-\\nanopia, due to compression of the optic chiasm), palsy of cranial nerves III, IV, VI \\n(pressure or invasion of the cavernous sinus; ﬁ g 5.25).

For Cushing’s \\ndisease see p225, prolactinoma p236, acromegaly p238.\\n  • Sur gery: (ﬁ g 5.26) Most pituitary surgery is trans-sphenoidal, but if there is supra-\\nsellar extension, a trans-frontal approach may be used. For prolactinoma, 1st-line \\ntreatment is medical with a dopamine agonist, p236. Pre-op: ensure hydrocortisone \\n100mg IV/IM. Subsequent cortisol replacement and reass essment varies with local \\nprotocols: get advice. Post-op: retest pituitary function  (p232) to assess replace-\\nment needs.

Good for residual or recurrent adenomas (good \\nr\\nates of tumour control and normalization of excess hormone secretion).27\\nPost-op Recurrence may occur late after surgery, so life-long follow-up is required. \\nF\\nertility should be discussed: this may be reduced post-op due to \\ue001gonadotropins.\\nPituitary apoplexy Rapid pituitary enlargement from a bleed into a tumour may \\ncause mass eff  \\nects, cardiovascular collapse due to acute hypopituit arism, and death.  \\nSuspect if acute onset of headache, meningism, \\ue001GCS, ophthalmo plegia/visual ﬁ eld \\ndefect, especially if there is a known tumour (may present like sub arachnoid haem-\\norrhage). \\ue057: Urgent steroids (hydrocortisone \\n100mg IV) and meticulous ﬂ uid balance \\n± cabergoline (dopamine agonist, if prolactinoma) ± surgery; ﬁ  nd the cause, eg a \\npredisposition to thrombosis, from antiphospholipid syndrome. \\nCraniopharyngioma Not strictly a pituitary tumour: it originates from Rath ke ’s \\npouch so is situated between the pituitary and 3rd ventricle ﬂ  oor.

It presents earlier \\nin women (menstrual disturbance) but later in men (eg with erectile dysfunction \\nand/or mass eff ects). Prolactin stimulates lactation.\\n11,12 Raised levels lead to hypo-\\ngonadism, infertility, and osteoporosis, by inhibiting secretion of gonadotropin-re-\\nleasing hormone (hence \\ue001\\nLH/FSH and \\ue001testosterone or oestrogen).\\nCauses of raised plasma prolactin (PRL; >390mU/L) PRL is secreted from the an-\\nterior pituitary and release is inhibited by dopamine produced in the hypothal amus. \\nHyperprolactinaemia may result from 1 Excess production from the pituitary, eg \\nprolactinoma. 2 Disinhibition, by compression of the pituitary stalk, reducing local \\ndopamine levels. 3 Use of a dopamine antagonist. A PRL of 1000–5000mU/L may re-\\nsult from any, but >5000 is likely to be due to a prolactinoma, with macroadenomas \\n(>10mm) having the highest levels, eg 10 000–100 000.\\n  • Ph ysiological: Pregnancy; breastfeeding; stress. Acute rises occur post-orgasm. 11\\n  • Drugs (most common cause): Metoclop r amide; haloperidol; methyldopa; oes-\\ntrogens; ecstasy/MDMA;12 antipsychotics (a reason for ‘non-compliance’: sustained \\nhyperprolactinaemia may cause \\ue001libido, anorgasmia, and erectile dysfunction). \\n  • Diseases:  P rolactinoma: micro- or macroadenoma; Stalk damage:  pituitary ad-\\nenomas, surgery, trauma; Hypo thalamic disease:  craniopharyngioma, other tu-\\nmours; Other: hypothyroidism (due to \\ue000TRH), chronic renal failure (\\ue001excretion).\\nSymptoms \\ue033: Amenorrhoea or oligomenorrhoea; infertility; galactorrhoea (ﬁ g 5.27). \\nAlso: \\ue001libido, \\ue000weight, dry vagina. \\ue032: Erectile dysfunction, \\ue001f acial hair, galactorrhoea. \\nMay present late with osteoporosis or local pressure eff ects from the tumour (p234).\\nTests Basal PRL: non-stressful venepuncture between 09.00 and 16.00h. Do a preg-\\nnancy test, TFT, U&E. MRI pituitary if other causes are ruled out.\\nManagement Refer to a specialist endocrinology clinic. Dopamine agonists (bro-\\nmocrip\\ntine or cabergoline) are 1st line.\\nMicroprolactinomas: A tumour <10mm on MRI (~25% of us have asymptomatic \\nmicroprolactinomas). Bromocriptine, a dopamine agonist, \\ue001PRL secretion, restores \\nmenstrual cycles and \\ue001tumour size. Dose is titrated up: 1.25mg PO; increase weekly \\nby 1.25–2.5mg/d until ~2.5mg/12h. SE: nausea, depression, postural hypotension (mini-\\nmize by giving at night). If pregnancy is planned, use barrier contraception until 2 \\nperiods have occurred. If subsequent pregnancy occurs, stop bromocriptine after \\nthe \\n1st missed period.  An alternative dopamine agonist is cabergoline: more eff ec-\\ntive and fewer SE, but there are fewer data on safety in pregnancy. NB: ergot alkaloids \\n(bromocriptine and cabergoline) can cause ﬁ  brosis (eg echocardiograms are need-\\ned). Trans-sphenoidal surgery may be considered if intolerant of dopamine agonists. \\nIt has a high success rate, but there are risks of permanent hormone deﬁ ciency and \\nprolactinoma recurrence, and so it is usually reserved as a \\n2nd-line treatment.\\nMacroprolactinomas: A tumour >10mm diameter on MRI. As they are near the optic \\nchiasm, there may be \\ue001acuity, diplopia, ophthalmoplegia, visual-ﬁ  eld loss, and op-\\ntic atrophy.  Treat initially with a dopamine agonist (bromocriptine if fertility is the \\ngoal). Surgery is rarely needed , but consider if visual symptoms or pressure eff ects \\nwhich fail to respond to medical treatment. Bromocriptine, and in some cases radia-\\ntion therapy, may be required post-op as complete surgical resection is uncommon. \\nIf pregnant, monitor closely ideally in a combined endocrine/antenatal clinic as there \\nis \\ue000risk of expansion.\\nFollow-up Monitor \\nPRL. If headache or visual loss, check ﬁ  elds (? do MRI). Medication \\ncan be decreased after 2yrs, but recurrence of hyperprolactinaemia and expansion \\nof the tumour may occur, and so these patients should be monitored carefully.\\n11 The prolactin increase (\\ue032 and \\ue033) after coitus is ~ 400% greater than after masturbation; post-orgasmic \\nprolactin is part of a feedback loop decreasing arousal by inhibiting central dopaminergic processes. The \\nsize of post-orgasmic prolactin increase is a neurohormonal index of sexual satisfaction.\\n12 MDMA also \\ue000oxytocin; prolactin + oxytocin are thought to mediate post-orgasmic well-being.\\n_OHCM_10e.indb   236_OHCM_10e.indb   236 02/05/2017   19:0702/05/2017   19:07'),\n",

In acromegaly GH release fails to suppress.\\n  • If basal serum GH is >0.4mcg/L (1.2mIU/L) and/or if \\ue000IGF-I (p232), \\nan oral glucose tolerance test (OGTT) is needed. If the lowest GH \\nvalue during OGTT is above 1mcg/L (3mIU/L), acro megaly is con-\\nﬁ rmed. With general use of very sensitive assays, it has been \\nsaid that this cut-off   be decreased to 0.3mcg/L ( 0.9mIU/L).28 \\nMethod: Collect samples for GH glucose at: 0, 30, 60, 90, 120, \\n150min. Possible false +ves: puberty, pregnancy, hepatic and \\nrenal disease, anorexia nervosa, and DM.\\n  • MRI scan of pituitary fossa. • Look for hypopituitarism (p232).\\n  • Visual ﬁ elds and acuity. • ECG, echo. Old photos if possible.\\nTreatment Aim to correct (or prevent) tumour compression by \\nexcising the lesion, and to reduce GH and IGF-I levels to at least a \\n‘safe’ GH level of <2mcg/L (<6mIU/L).  A 3-part strategy: 1 Trans-\\nsphenoidal surgery is often 1st line. 2 If surgery fails to correct \\nGH/IGF-I hypersecretion, try somatostatin analogues (SSA) and/or \\nradiotherapy, SSA being generally preferred. Example: octreotide \\n(Sandostatin LAR®, given monthly IM), or lanreotide (Somatuline \\nLA®). SE: pain at the injection site; gastrointestinal : abdominal \\ncramps, ﬂ atulence, loose stools, \\ue000gallstones; impaired glucose \\ntolerance. 3 The GH antagonist pegvisomant (recombinant GH ana-\\nlogue) is used if resistant or intolerant to SSA. It supp resses IGF-1 \\nto normal in 90%, but GH levels may rise; rarely tumour size in-\\ncreases, so monitor closely. Radiotherapy: If unsuited to sur gery \\nor as adjuvant; may take years to work. Follow-up: Yearly GH, IGF-\\n1  ± OGTT; visual ﬁ  elds; vascular assess ment. BMI; photos (ﬁ g 5.29).\\nPrognosis May return to normal (any excess mortality is mostly \\nvascular). 16% get diabetes with SSAs vs ~13% after surgery. \\nFig 5.28 Acromegaly.

Nonetheless, for many of our increasingly overweight population, simply \\neating less (eg \\n2500 calories/d for men and 2000 for women) and balancing in-\\ntake across food groups seems a sensible start. Diet is of course not independent \\nof lifestyle, and we should continue to promote a balanced diet in the context of \\nthe full range of public health messages.

Overly proscriptive applica-\\ntion of such population-level data in advice given to individuals (as journalists may \\nbe prone to do) will always be ﬂ  awed and risks drowning important fundamental \\nconcepts in a sea of cynicism.\\nCurrent recommendations must take into account three facts\\n  • Obesity costs health services as much as smoking\\n—1 in 4 UK adults is obese. \\n  • Diabetes mellitus is burgeoning: in some places prevalence is >7% (p206).\\n  • Past advice has not changed eating habits in large sections of the population.\\nAdvice is likely to focus on the following\\nBody mass inde\\nx: (BMI; table 6.1.) Aim for 18.5–25. Controlling quantity may be more \\nimportant than quality. In hypertension, eating the ‘right’ things lowers BP only mar-\\nginally, but controlling weight causes a more signiﬁ cant reduction.\\nBase meals on starch: (Bread, rice, potatoes, pasta.) These provide a slower re-\\nlease f\\norm of carbohydrate compared to diets containing reﬁ  ned sugar, and be-\\nware of the high sugar contents of, eg soft drinks.\\nEat enough fruit and vegetables:  Aiming for 5 portions a day.\\nEat foods high in fat, salt, or sugar infrequently.\\nE\\nat some meat, ﬁ sh, eggs, and beans:  Aim f or 2 portions of ﬁ  sh a week, includ-\\ning oily ﬁ sh (those rich in omega- 3 fatty acid, such as mackerel, herring, pilchards, \\nsalmon). Non-dairy sources of protein include beans and nuts. Aim to reduce intake \\nof red or processed meat to <70g/day.\\nEat some milk and dairy products:  Select those op tions with lower fat, sugar and \\nsalt where possible.\\nModerate alcohol use (adults <65yrs): \\ue00514U/wk for both men and women, spread \\nover 3 or more days.

Vitamin D supplements \\n(10mcg/day) may beneﬁ t breast-feeding mothers, those ≥65yrs old, those whose \\nskin is not typically exposed to sun, or those with very dark skin. Lower doses may be \\nrecommended for infants and young children.\\n\\ue007T\\nhis diet is not appropriate for all: • <5yrs old. • Need for low residue (eg \\nCr\\nohn’s, UC, p264) or special diet (coeliac disease, p 266).

So many GI \\ninvestigations are indirect...now is your chance for direct observation.\\nLeucoplakia (ﬁ g 6.2) Is an oral mucosal white patch that will not rub off   and is \\nnot attributable to any other known disease. It is a premalignant lesion, with a \\ntransformation rate, which ranges from 0.6% to 18%.  Oral hairy leucoplakia is a \\nshaggy white patch on the side of the tongue seen in HIV, caused by EBV. \\ue007When \\nin doub\\nt, refer all intra-oral white lesions (see BOX).\\nAphthous ulcers ( ﬁ g 6.3) 20% of us get these shallow, painful ulcers on the \\ntongue or oral mucosa that heal without scarring. Causes of severe ulcers:  \\nCr\\nohn’s and coeliac disease; Behçet’s (p 694); trauma; erythema multiforme; lichen \\nplanus; pemphigus; pemphigoid; infections (herpes simplex, syphilis, Vincent’s \\nangina, p\\n712). \\ue057: Minor ulcers:  a void oral trauma (eg hard toothbrushes or foods \\nsuch as toast) and acidic foods or drinks. Tetracycline or antimicrobial mouth-\\nwashes (eg chlorhexidine) with topical steroids (eg triamcinolone gel) and topical \\nanalgesia. Severe ulcers: possible ther\\n apies include systemic corticosteroids (eg \\noral prednisolone 30–60mg/d PO for a week) or thalidomide (absolutely contraindi-\\ncated in pregnancy). \\ue007Biopsy any ulcer not healing after 3 weeks to exclude mal-\\nignancy; refer to an oral surgeon if uncertain.\\nCandidiasis (thrush) (ﬁ g 6.4) Causes white patches or erythema of the buccal mu-\\ncosa. P\\natches may be hard to remove and bleed if scraped. Risk factors: Extremes \\no\\nf age; DM; antibiotics; immunosuppression (long-term corticosteroids, including in-\\nhalers; cytotoxics; malignancy; HIV). \\ue057: Ny statin  suspension 400 000U (4mL swill and \\nswallow/6h). Fluconazole for oropharyngeal thrush.\\nCheilitis (angular stomatitis) Fissuring of the mouth’s corners is caused by denture \\npr\\noblems, candidiasis, or deﬁ ciency of iron or riboﬂ avin (vitamin B2).

Pig-\\nmentation anywhere in the mouth suggests Addison’s disease (p 226) or drugs (eg \\nanti malarials). Consider malignant melanoma. Telangiectasia: Systemic sclerosis; \\nOsler–Weber–Rendu syndrome (p 708). Fordyce glands: (Creamy yellow spots at \\nthe bor\\nder of the oral mucosa and the lip vermilion.) Sebaceous cysts, common \\nand benign. Aspergillus niger  colonization may cause a black tongue.\\nTeeth (ﬁ g 6.6) A blue line at the gum –tooth margin suggests lead poisoning. Pre-\\nnatal or childhood tetracycline exposure causes a yellow–brown discolouration.\\nTongue This may be furred or dry (xerostomia) in dehydration, drug therapy,3 after \\nradiotherapy, in Crohn’s disease, Sjögren’s (p710), and Mikulicz’s syndrome (p706).\\nGlossitis: Means a smooth, red, sore tongue, eg caused by iron, folate, or B12 deﬁ -\\nciency (ﬁ g 8.27, p335). If local loss of papillae leads to ulcer-like lesions that change \\nin colour and size, use the term geographic tongue (harmless migratory glossitis).\\nMacroglossia: The tongue is too big. Causes: myxoedema; acromegaly; amyloid \\n(p370). A ranula is a bluish salivary retention cyst to one side of the frenulum, \\nnamed aft\\ner the bulging vocal pouch of frogs’ throats (genus Rana).\\nTongue cancer: Appears as a raised ulcer with ﬁ  rm edges.

Pre-procedure:  Stop PPIS 2wks pre-\\nop if possible (\\ue013 pathology-masking). Nil by mouth for 6h before. Don’t drive for 24h \\nif sedation is used. Procedure: Sedation optional, eg midazolam 1–5mg slowly IV (to \\nremain conscious; if deeper sedation is needed, propofol via an anaesthetist (narrow \\ntherapeutic range)); nasal prong O2 (eg 2L/min; monitor respirations & oximetry). The \\npharynx may be sprayed with local anaesthetic before the endoscope is passed. Con-\\ntinuous suction must be available to prevent aspiration. Complications:  Sore throat; \\namnesia from sedation; perforation (<0.1%); bleeding (if on aspirin, clopidogrel,  war-\\nfarin, or DOACS these need stopping only if therapeutic procedure). Duodenal biopsy:  \\nThe gold standard test for coeliac disease (p 266); also useful in unusual causes of \\nmalabsorption, eg giardiasis, lymphoma, Whipple’s disease.\\nSigmoidoscopy Views the rectum + distal colon (to ~splenic ﬂ exure). Flexible \\nsigmoidoscopy has largely displaced rigid sigmoidoscopy for diagnosis of distal \\ncolonic pathology, but ~25% of cancers are still out of reach. It can be used thera-\\npeutically, eg for decompression of sigmoid volvulus (p611). Preparation: Phosphate \\nenema PR. Procedure: Learn from an expert; do PR exam ﬁ rst. Do biopsies—macro-\\nscopic appearances may be normal, eg IBD, amyloidosis, microscopic colitis.\\nColonoscopy Indications: See table 6.3. Preparation:  Stop iron 1wk prior; dis-\\ncuss with local endoscopy unit bowel preparation and diet required. Procedure: Do \\nPR ﬁ rst. Sedation (see earlier in topic) and analgesia are given before colonoscope is \\npassed and guided around the colon. Complications: Abdominal discomfort; incom-\\nplete examination; haemorrhage after biopsy or polypectomy; perforation (<0.1%). \\nSee ﬁ gs 6.7–6.11. Post-procedure: no alcohol, and no operating machinery for 24h.\\nVideo capsule endoscopy ( VCE) To evaluate obscure GI bleeding (p 326) and to \\ndetect small bowel pathology. Use small bowel imaging (eg contrast) or patency \\ncapsule test ahead of VCE if patient has abdominal pain or symptoms suggesting \\nsmall bowel obstruction. Preparation:  Clear ﬂ  uids only the evening before then \\nnil by mouth from morning until 4h after capsule swallowed. Procedure: Capsule is \\nswallowed (ﬁ g 6.12)—this transmits video wirelessly to cap-\\nture device worn by patient. Normal activity can take place \\nfor the day. Complications:  Capsule retention in 1% (endo-\\nscopic or surgical removal is needed)—avoid MRI for 2 wks \\nafter unless AXR conﬁ rms capsule has cleared; obstruction, \\nincomplete exam (eg slow transit, achalasia). Problems: No \\ntherapeutic options; poor localization of lesions; may miss \\nmore subtle lesions.\\nLiver biopsy Route: Percutaneous if INR in range else trans jugular with FFP.

Mechanical or motility related? (See BOX \\n‘Causes of dysphagia’.)\\nFive key questions to ask\\n1\\n      Was there diffi  cult y swallowing solids and liquids from the start?\\nYes: motility disorder (eg achalasia, CNS, or pharyngeal causes).\\nNo: Solids then liquids: suspect a stricture (benign or malignant).\\n2       Is it diffi  cult to initiate a swallowing movement?\\nYes: Suspect bulbar palsy, especially if patient coughs on swallowing.\\n3       Is swallowing painful (odynophagia)?\\nY\\nes: Suspect ulceration (malignancy, oesophagitis, viral infection or Candida in \\nimmunocompromised, or poor steroid inhaler technique) or spasm.\\n4       Is the dysphagia intermittent or is it constant and getting worse?\\nInt\\nermittent: suspect oesophageal spasm.\\nConstant and worsening: suspect malignant stricture.\\n5       Does the neck bulge or gurgle on drinking?\\nY\\nes: Suspect a pharyngeal pouch (see OHCS p570).\\nSigns Is the patient cachectic or anaemic? Examine the mouth; feel for supraclavic-\\nular nodes (left supr\\naclavicular node = Virchow’s node—suggests intra-abdominal ma-\\nlignancy); look for signs of systemic disease, eg systemic sclerosis (p552), CNS disease.\\nTests FBC (anaemia); U&E (dehydration). Upper GI endoscopy ± biopsy (ﬁ g 6.13). If suspi-\\ncion of pharyngeal pouch consider contrast swallow (± ENT opinion). Video ﬂ uoroscopy \\nmay help identify neurogenic causes. Oesophageal manometry for dysmotility.\\nSpeciﬁ c conditions Oesophagitis: See p254. Diffuse oesophageal spasm: Causes in-\\nt\\nermittent dysphagia ± chest pain. Contrast swallow/manometry: abnormal contrac-\\ntions.5 Achalasia: Coordinated peristalsis is lost and the lower oesophageal sphincter \\nf\\nails to relax (due to degeneration of the myenteric plexus), causing dysphagia, re-\\ngurgitation, and \\ue001weight. Characteristic ﬁ ndings on manometry or contrast swallow \\nshowing dilated tapering oesophagus. Treatment: endoscopic balloon dilatation, or \\nHeller’s cardiomyotomy\\n—then proton pump inhibitors (PPIS, p254). Botulinum toxin in-\\njection if a non-invasive procedure is needed (repeat every few months). Calcium chan-\\nnel blockers and nitrates may also relax the sphincter. Benign oesophageal stricture: \\nCaused by gastro-oesophageal reﬂ ux \\n (GORD, p254), corrosives, surgery, or radiotherapy. \\nTreatment: endoscopic balloon dilatation. Oesophageal cancer: (p618.) Associations: \\n\\ue032, GORD, tobacco, alcohol, Barrett’s oesophagus (p695), tylosis (palmar hyperkeratosis), \\nPlummer–Vinson syndrome (post-cricoid dysphagia, upper oesophageal web + iron-\\ndeﬁ ciency). CNS causes: Ask for help from a speech and language therapist.\\nNausea and vomiting\\nConsider pregnancy where appropriate! Other causes, p56.\\nWhat’s in the vomit? Reports of ‘coff ee grounds’ may indicate upper GI bleeding \\nbut represent one of the most over-called signs in clinical medicine — always verify \\nyourself and look for other evidence of GI bleeding; recognizable food ≈ gastric stasis; \\nfeculent ≈ small bowel obstruction.\\nTiming Morning ≈ pr egnancy or \\ue000ICP; 1h post food ≈ gastric stasis/gastroparesis (DM); \\nvomiting that relieves pain ≈ peptic ulcer; preceded by loud gurgling ≈ GI obstruction.\\nTests Bloods: FBC, U&E, LFT, Ca2+, glucose, amylase. ABG: A metabolic (hypochlor-\\naemic) alk\\nalosis from loss of gastric contents (pH >7.45, \\ue000HCO3 \\nΩ) indicates severe \\nvomiting. Plain AXR: If suspected bowel obstruction (p 728). Upper GI endoscopy: \\n(See p248.) If suspicion of bleed or persistent vomiting. Consider head CT in case \\ue000ICP.\\nTreatment Identify and tr eat underlying causes . Symptomatic relief: table 6.4. Be \\npre-emptive, eg pre-op for post-op symptoms. Try oral route ﬁ rst. 30% need a 2nd-line \\nanti-emetic, so be prepared to prescribe more than one.

Gastric antisecretory agents, eg H2 re-\\nceptor antagonists (H2RAS), and proton pump inhibitors (PPIS) may only work if you \\nhave optimized cytoprotection (antacids and sucralfate work this way). Success may \\ndepend on you being not just a brilliant general, but also a tactician, politician, and \\ndiplomat. Plan your strategy carefully\\n4 (ﬁ g 6.14). As in any war, neglecting psycho-\\nlogical factors can prove disastrous. The aim is not outright victory but maintaining \\nthe balance of power so all may prosper.\\nSymptoms Epigastric pain often related to hunger, speciﬁ c foods, or time of day, \\nfullness after meals, heart burn (retro sternal pain); tender epi gastrium. Beware \\nAlarm symptoms: Anaemia (iron deﬁ ciency ); loss of weight; anorexia; recent on-\\nset/\\nprogressive symptoms; melaena/haematemesis; swallowing diffi  cult y.\\nH. pylori (See table 6.5.)

If Ωve give acid \\nsuppression alone. \\ue007Refer for urgent endoscopy (p248) all with dysphagia, as well \\nas those \\ue00655 with alarm symptoms or with treatment-refractory dyspepsia.\\nDuodenal ulcer (DU, ﬁ g 6.15.) 4-fold commoner than GU. Major risk factors: H.  py-\\nlori (90%); drugs  (NSAIDS; steroids; SSRI). Minor: \\ue000Gastric acid secretion;  \\ue000gastric \\nemptying (\\ue001duodenal pH); blood group O; smoking.\\nSymptoms: Asympto matic or epigastric pain (r elieved by antacids) ± \\ue001weight. Signs: \\nEpigastric tenderness. Diagnosis: Upper GI endoscopy. Test for H. pylori. Measure \\ngastrin con cen trations when off  PPIS if Zollinger –Ellison syndrome (p 716) is sus-\\npected. \\ue059\\ue059: Non-ulcer dyspepsia; duodenal Crohn’s; TB; lymphoma; pancreatic cancer \\n(p270). Follow-up: None; if good response to \\ue014 (eg PPI).\\nGastric ulcers ( GU.) Occur mainly in the elderly, on the lesser curve. Ulcers else-\\nwher\\ne are more often malignant. Risk factors: H. pylori (~80%); smoking; NSAIDS; re-\\nﬂ ux of duodenal contents; delayed gastric emptying; stress, eg neurosurgery or burns \\n(Cushing’s or Curling’s ulcers). Symptoms: Asympto matic or epigastric pain (r elieved \\nby antacids) ± \\ue001weight. Tests: Upper GI endoscopy to exclude malignancy (ﬁ g 6.14); \\nmultiple biopsies from ulcer rim and base (histology, H. pylori). Repeat endoscopy af-\\nter 6–8 weeks to conﬁ rm healing and exclude malignancy.\\nGastritis Risk fact ors: Alcohol, NSAIDS, H. pylori, reﬂ ux/hiatus hernia, atrophic \\ngastritis, granulo mas (Crohn’s; sarcoidosis), CMV, Zollinger–Ellison syndrome &  Mé-\\nnétrier’s disease (p716 & 706).

H2 blockers have a place (ranitidine 300mg each night PO for 8wks).\\nDrug-induced ulcers: Stop drug if possible. PPIS may be best for treating and pre-\\nventing GI ulcers and bleeding in patients on NSAID or antiplatelet drugs. Misopros-\\ntol is an alternative with diff erent SE.  If symptoms persist, re-endoscope, retest for \\nH. pylori, and reconsider diff erential diagnoses (eg gallstones). Surgery: See p622.\\nComplications \\ue022Bleeding (p256), \\ue022perforation (p606), malignancy, \\ue001gastric outﬂ ow.\\nFunctional (non-ulcer) dyspepsia Common. H. p ylori eradication (only after a +ve \\nresult) may help. Some evidence favours PPIS and psychotherapy. Low-dose ami-\\ntriptyline (10–20mg each night PO) may help. Ant acids, antispasmodics, H2 blockers, \\nmisoprostol, prokinetic agents, bismuth, or sucralfate all have less evidence. \\n6 H. pylori is the commonest bacterial pathogen found worldwide ( >50% of the world population over \\n40yrs has it). It’s a class I carcinogen causing gastritis (p 252), duodenal/gastric ulcers & gastric cancer/\\nlymphoma (MALT, p362), also associated with coronary artery disease, B12 and iron deﬁ ciency.\\n7 1 week of therapy suffi  cient; 2 weeks increases erradication rates by ~5% but also increases SE.

Accepted deﬁ nitions and \\nreported rates vary, but a place to start is the passage of ≤2 bowel motions/wk, \\noften passed with diffi  culty, straining, or pain, and a sense of incomplete evacua-\\ntion. \\ue033:\\ue032≈2:1. Doctors’ chief concerns are to ﬁ nd pointers to major pathology, eg \\nconstip ation + rectal bleeding ≈ cancer; constipation + distension + active bowel \\nsounds ≈ stricture/GI obstruction; constipation + menorrhagia ≈ hypothyroidism.\\nThe patient Ask about frequency, nature, and consistency of stools. Is there blood \\nor mucus in/\\non the stools? Is there diarrhoea alternating with constipation (eg IBS, \\np266)? Has there been recent change in bowel habit? Is she digitating the rectum \\nor vagina to pass stool? 15 Ask about diet and drugs. \\ue007PR examination is essential \\neven when referring (refer if signs of colorectal ca, eg \\ue001weight, pain, or anaemia).\\nTests None in young, mildly aff  ected patients. Threshold for investigation di-\\nminishes with age; triggers include: 6 \\ue001weight, abdominal mass, +PR blood, iron \\ndeﬁ ciency anaemia. Blood: FBC, ESR, U&E, Ca2+, TFT. Colonoscopy:  If suspected colo-\\nr\\nectal malignancy. Transit studies; anorectal physiology; biopsy for Hirschprung’s \\nare occasionally needed.\\nTreatment Often reassurance, drinking more, and diet/exercise advice (p 245) is \\nall that is needed.  Treat causes ( BOX ‘Causes of constipation’). A high-ﬁ  bre diet \\nis often advised, but may cause bloating without helping constipation. \\ue007Only use \\ndrugs if these measur\\nes fail, and try to use them for short periods only. Often, \\na stimulant such as senna ± a bulking agent is more eff  ective and cheaper than \\nagents such as lactulose. Bulking agents: \\ue000F aecal mass, so stimulating peristal-\\nsis. They must be taken with plenty of ﬂ  uid and may take a few days to act. CI: \\ndiffi  culty in swallowing; GI obstruction; colonic atony; faecal impaction. Bran \\npowder 3.5g 2–3 times/d with food (may hinder absorption of dietary trace ele-\\nments if taken with every meal).   Ispaghula husk, eg 1 Fybogel® sachet after a \\nmeal, mixed in water and swallowed promptly (or else it becomes an unpleasant \\nsludge). Meth ylcellulose, eg Celevac® 3–6 tablets/ 12h with ≥ 300mL water. Ster-\\nculia, eg Normacol® granules, 10mL sprinkled on food daily. Stimulant laxatives: \\nIncrease intestinal motility, so do not use in intestinal obstruction or acute colitis. \\nA\\nvoid prolonged use as it may cause colonic atony. Abdominal cramps are an \\nimportant SE. Pure stimulant laxa tives are bisacodyl table ts (5–10mg at night) or \\nsuppositories ( 10mg in the mornings) and senna ( 2–4 tablets at night). Docusate \\nsodium and dantron 16 have stimulant and softening actions. Glycerol  supposito-\\nries act as a rectal stimulant. Sodium picosulfate ( 5–10mg at night) is a potent \\nstimulant. Stool softeners: Particularly useful when managing painful anal condi-\\ntions, eg ﬁ \\nssure. Arachis oil enemas lubricate and soften impacted f aeces. Liquid \\nparaffi  n should not be used for a prolonged period ( SE: anal seepage, lipoid pneu-\\nmonia, malabsorption of fat-soluble vitamins). Osmotic laxatives: Retain ﬂ uid in \\nthe bowel. Lactulose, a semisynthetic disaccharide, produces osmotic diarrhoea \\nof low faecal pH that discourages growth of ammonia-producing organisms.  It \\nis useful in hepatic enceph alopathy (initial dose: 30–50mL/12h). SE: bloating, so \\nits role in treating constipation is limited. Macrogol  (eg Movicol®) is another ex-\\nample. Magnesium salts (eg magnesium hydroxide; magnesium sulfate) are use-\\nful when rapid bowel evacuation is r equired. Sodium salts (eg Micr olette® and \\nMicralax® enemas) should be avoided as they may cause sodium and water re-\\ntention. Phosphate enemas are useful for rapid bowel evacuation prior to proce-\\ndures.\\nIf these don’t help Prucalopride is an electiv\\n e 5HT4 agonist with prokinetic prop-\\nerties; Lubiprostone is a chloride-channel activator that increases intestinal ﬂ  uid \\nsecretion; Linaclotide is a guanylate cyclase-C agonist that also increases ﬂ uid se-\\ncretion and decreases visceral pain. A multidisciplinary approach with behaviour \\ntherapy, habit training ± sphincter biofeedback may help.\\n15  Rectocele: front wall of the rectum bulges into the back wall of the vagina.\\n16  Dantron causes colon & liver tumours in animals,  so reserve use for the very elderly or terminally ill.\\n_OHCM_10e.indb   260_OHCM_10e.indb   260 02/05/2017   19:0702/05/2017   19:07'),\n",

It may \\naff ect just the rectum (proctitis, as in ~30%) or extend to involve part of the colon (left-\\nsided colitis, in ~40%) or the entire colon (pancolitis, in ~30%). It ‘never’ spreads proxi-\\nmal to the ileocaecal valve (except for backwash ileitis). Cause Inappropriate immune \\nr\\nesponse against (?abnormal) colonic ﬂ  ora in genetically susceptibile individuals. Pa-\\nthology Hyperaemic/haemorrhagic colonic mucosa ± pseudo polyps f ormed by in-\\nﬂ ammation. Punctate ulcers may extend deep into the lamina propria—inﬂ ammation \\nis norm ally not transmural. Continuous inﬂ  ammation limited to the mucosa diff erenti-\\nates it from Crohn’s disease. Prevalence 100–200/100 000. Incid ence 10–20/100 000/\\nyr; typically presents ~20–40yrs. UC is 3-fold as common in non-smokers (the opposite \\nis true for Crohn’s disease)—symptoms may relapse on stopping smoking.\\nSymptoms Episodic or chronic diarrhoea  (±  blood & mucus); crampy abdom inal \\ndis comfort; bowel frequency relates to severity  (see table 6.8); urgency/tenes-\\nmus ≈ proctitis. Systemic symptoms in attacks: fever, malaise, anorexia, \\ue001weight.\\nSigns May be none. In acute, severe UC there may be fever, tachycardia, and a ten-\\nder, distended abdomen. Extraintestinal signs: Clubbing; aphthous oral ulcers; ery-\\nthema nodosum (p 265); pyoderma gangrenosum; conjunctivitis; episcleritis; iritis; \\nlarge joint arthritis; sacroiliitis; ankylosing spondylitis; PSC (p282); nutritional deﬁ cits.\\nTests Blood: FBC, ESR, CRP, U&E, LFT, blood culture.

Pathology Mostly ductal adenocarcinoma (met astasiz\\n e \\nearly; present late). 60% arise in the pancreas head, 25% in the body, 15% tail. A few \\narise in the ampulla of Vater (ampullary tumour) or pancreatic islet cells (insulinoma, \\ngastrinoma, glucagonomas, somatostatinomas (p\\n223), VIPomas); both have a better \\nprognosis. Genetics ~95% have mutations in the KRAS2 gene.\\nThe patient Tumours in the head of the pancreas present with painless obstruc-\\ntiv\\ne jaundice. 75% of tumours in the body and tail present with epigastric pain (ra-\\ndiates to back and relieved by sitting forward). Either may cause anorexia, weight \\nloss, diabetes, or acute pancreatitis. Rarer features: Thrombophlebitis migrans (eg \\nan arm v\\nein becomes swollen and red, then a leg vein); \\ue000Ca 2+; marantic endocardi-\\ntis; portal hypertension (splenic vein thrombosis); nephrosis (renal vein metasta-\\nses). Signs: Jaundice + palpable gallbladder (Courvoisier’s ‘law’, p 272); epigastric \\nmass; hepatomegaly; splenomegaly; lymphadenopathy; ascites.\\nTests Blood: Cholestatic jaundice. \\ue000 CA 19–9 (p531) is non-speciﬁ  c, but helps assess \\nprognosis. Imaging: US or CT can show a pancreatic mass ± dilated biliary tree ± \\nhepatic metastases. They can guide biopsy and help staging prior to surgery/stent \\ninsertion. \\nERCP/MRCP (p742) show biliary tree anatomy and may localize the site of \\nobstruction.

Post-op morbidity is high (mortal-\\nity <5%); non-curative resection confers no survival beneﬁ t. Laparoscopic excision:  \\nT\\nail lesions are easiest. Post-op chemotherapy: Delays disease progression. Pal-\\nliation o\\nf jaundice: Endoscopic or percutaneous stent insertion may help jaundice \\nand anor\\nexia. Rarely, palliative bypass surgery is done for duodenal obstruction or \\nunsuccessful ERCP. Pain: Disabling pain may need big doses of opiates (p575), or radi-\\notherapy. Coeliac plexus inﬁ ltration with alcohol may be done at the time of surgery, \\nor percutaneously. Referral to a palliative care team is essential.\\nPrognosis Often dismal. Mean survival <6 months. 5yr survival: 3%. Overall 5yr sur-\\nvival after Whipple’s procedure 5–14%.

Jaundice is classiﬁ  ed by the site of the problem (pre-\\nhepatic, hepatocellular, or cholestatic/ob structive) or by the type of circulating bili-\\nrubin (conjugated or unconj ugated, ﬁ g 6.25).\\nUnconjugated hyperbili rubinaemia As unconjugated bilirubin is water-insoluble, \\nit does no\\nt enter urine, resulting in unconjugated hyperbili rubinaemia.\\nOverproduction: Haemolysis (p338, eg malaria/DIC, etc); ineff ective erythropoiesis.\\nImpaired hepatic uptake: Drugs (paracetamol, rifampicin), ischaemic hepatitis.\\nImpaired conjugation: Eponymous syndromes: Gilbert’s, p700; Crigler–Najjar, p696.\\nPhysiological neonatal jaundice: Caused by a combination of the above, OHCS p115.\\nConjugated hyperbili rubinaemia As conjugated bilirubin is water-soluble, it is \\ne\\nxcreted in urine, making it dark. Less conjugated bilirubin enters the gut and the \\nfaeces become pale. When severe, it can be associated with an intractable pruri-\\ntus which is best treated by relief of the obstruction.\\nHepatocellular dysfunction: There is hepatocyte damage, usually with some chole-\\nstasis. Causes: Viruses: hepatitis (p 278), CMV (p 405), EBV (p 405); drugs (see ta-\\nble 6.10); alcohol; cirrhosis (see BOX ‘Causes of jaundice’); liver metastases/abscess; \\nhaemo chromatosis; autoimmune hepatitis (AIH); septicaemia; leptospirosis; syphilis; \\n\\ue0251-anti trypsin deﬁ ciency (p290); Budd–Chiari (p696); Wilson’s disease (p285); failure \\nto excrete conjugated bilirubin (Dubin –Johnson & Rotor syndromes, p 698, p 710); \\nright heart failure; toxins, eg carbon tetrachloride; fungi (ﬁ g 6.26).\\nImpaired hepatic excretion (cholestasis): Primary biliary cholangitis; primary \\nscler\\nosing cholangitis; drugs (see table 6.10); common bile duct gallstones; pan-\\ncreatic cancer; compression of the bile duct, eg lymph nodes at the porta hepatis; \\ncholangiocarcinoma; choledochal cyst; Caroli’s disease;\\n23 Mirrizi’s syndrome (ob-\\nstructive jaundice from common bile duct compression by a gallstone impacted in \\nthe cystic duct, often associated with cholangitis).\\nThe patient Ask: About blood transfusions,\\n IV drug use,  body piercing,  tattoos, \\nsexual activity, travel abroad, jaundiced contacts, family history, alcohol use, and all \\nmedications (eg old drug charts; GP records). Examine: For signs of chronic liver dis-\\nease (p276), hepatic encephalopathy (p275), lymph adenopathy, hepatomegaly, spleno-\\nmegaly, ascites, and a palpable gallbladder (if seen with painless jaundice the cause \\nis not gallstones\\n—Courvoisier’s ‘law’).24 Pale stools + dark urine ≈ cholestatic jaundice.\\nTests See p 276 for screening tests in suspected liver disease.  Urine: Bilirubin is \\nabsent in pr\\ne-hepatic causes; in obstructive jaundice, urobilinogen is absent. Hae-\\nmat\\nology: FBC, clotting, ﬁ  lm, reticulocyte count, Coombs’ test and haptoglobins \\nfor haemolysis (p 336), malaria parasites (eg if unconjugated bilirubin/fever); Paul \\nBunnell (EBV). Chemistry: U&E, LFT, \\ue034-GT, total protein, albumin. 25 Paracetamol lev-\\nels. Microbiology: Blood and other cultures; hepatitis serology. Ultrasound: Are \\nthe bile ducts dilat\\ned? Are there gallstones, hepatic metastases, or a pancreatic \\nmass? ERCP: (See p742.) If bile ducts are dilated and LFT not improving. MRCP: (See \\np742.) Or endoscopic ultrasound ( EUS) if conventional ultrasound  shows gallstones \\nbut no deﬁ nite com mon bile duct stones. Liver biopsy: (See p 248.) If bile ducts \\nare normal.

MRI: \\ue000Caudat e lobe size, smaller islands of regenerating nodules, and the pres-\\nence of the right posterior hepatic notch are more frequent in alcoholic cirrhosis \\nthan in virus-induced cirrhosis. Ascitic tap: Should be performed and ﬂ  \\n uid sent for \\nurgent MC&S—neutrophils >250/mm3 indicates spontaneous bacterial peritonitis (see \\nlater in topic for treatment). Liver biopsy: (See p248.) Conﬁ  rms the clinical diagnosis.\\nManagement General: Good nutrition is vital. Alcohol abstinence (p 280). Avoid \\nNSAIDS, sedatives, and opiates. Colestyramine helps pruritus ( 4g/12h PO, 1h after \\nother drugs). Consider ultrasound ±  \\ue025-fetoprotein every 6 months to screen for \\nHCC (p286) in those where this information will change management. Speciﬁ c: For \\nhepatitis-induced cirrhosis see p278. High-dose ursodeoxycholic acid in PBC (p282) \\nmay improve LFT and improve transplant-free survival. P enicillamine f or Wilson’s \\ndisease (p 285). Ascites: Fluid restriction ( <1.5L/d), low-salt diet ( 40–100mmol/d). \\nGive spironolactone 100mg/24h PO; \\ue000dose as tolerated (max 400mg/24h)—it coun-\\nters deranged renin–angiotensin–aldosterone (RAA) axis. Chart daily weight and aim \\nfor weight loss of ≤ ½kg/d. If response is poor, add fur osemide ≤120mg/24h PO; do \\nU&E (watch Na+) often. Therapeutic paracentesis with concomitant albumin infusion \\n(6–8g/L ﬂ uid removed) may be required. Spontaneous bacterial peritonitis ( SBP): \\n\\ue007Must be considered in any patient with ascites who deteriorates suddenly (may \\nbe as\\nymptomatic). Common organisms are E. coli, Klebsiella, and streptococci. \\ue014: eg \\npiperacillin with tazobactam 4.5g/8h for 5d or until sensitivities known. Give prophy-\\nlaxis for high-risk patients (\\ue001albumin, \\ue000PT/INR, low ascitic albumin) or those who have \\nhad a previous episode: eg ciproﬂ oxacin 500mg PO daily.

In this time, the comparatively sim-\\nple genome of HCV has proven far easier than HIV to combat and the treatment \\nof HCV has undergone nothing less than a revolution to the point where many \\ncommon genotypes are considered curable.\\nAll patients with sustained detectable HCV should be considered for treatment. \\nOptions are evolving rapidly, but centre on the use of inhibitors of non-structural \\nviral proteins (eg ledipasvir+sofosbuvir) which are much better tolerated than the \\nprevious mainstay of tr eatment, pegylated interferon. Interferon-free regimens \\ntherefore eliminate major barriers to compliance including treatment duration and \\nSES, as well as achieving superior results: contemporary antiviral regimens can now \\nrealistically achieve the complete absence of PCR detectable virus in the blood 6 \\nmonths post-treatment in almost 100% of genotype 1 patients, including patients \\nwith established cirrhosis. Ribavirin, a nucleoside analogue, can also increasingly \\nbe avoided in genotype 1, though it remains a useful treatment for the harder to \\ntreat genotypes 2 and 3. Here, reported rates of sustained undetectable viral levels \\nnow routinely exceed 90%. The costs of treatment are staggering, but cost-eff ec-\\ntiveness analysis is favourable given the high cure rates and the signiﬁ cant public \\nhealth burden of HCV. Genotypes 4, 5, or 6 are prevalent in lower-income countries \\nand have received less attention but limited data where resources do exist suggest \\nsimilarly good response rates.\\nMeanwhile, the threat of HIV remains. HCV prevalence is ~7% for sexually trans-\\nmitted HIV and >90% for IV transmission. Untreated HIV may accelerate progress \\nof HCV-induced liver ﬁ brosis. All HIV/HCV co-infected patients should be assessed \\nfor combination antiviral therapy. Given the potential for toxicities and viral resist-\\nance mutation, such therapies should be planned and delivered through expert \\nservices. \\nThe virologists’ triumph: curing HCV\\nFig 6.29 Viral events in hepatitis B in relation to AST peak.

Fatty liver:  Acute/reversible, but may progress \\nt\\no cirrhosis if drinking continues (also seen in obesity, DM, and with amiodarone). \\nAlcoholic hepatitis: See BOX ‘Managing alcoholic hepatitis’.  80% progress to cir-\\nrhosis (hepatic failure in 10%). Cirrhosis: (See p276.) 5yr survival is 48% if drinking \\ncontinues (if not, 77%).

Vitamins may be needed (p714). Prevention: (OHCS p512.) Alcohol-\\nfree beers; price may help promote lower-risk drinking. NB: there are no absolutes: \\nrisk is a continuum. Suggest: 1 Graceful ways of declining a drink, eg ‘I’m seeing \\nwhat it’s like to go without for a bit’. 2 Not buying him- or herself a drink when it is \\nhis/her turn. 3 ‘Don’t lift your glass to your lips until after the slowest drinker in your \\ngroup takes a drink.’ 4 ‘Sip, don’t gulp.’ Give follow-up and encouragement. Treating \\nes\\ntablished alcoholics: May be rewarding, particularly if they really want to change. \\nI\\nf so, group therapy or self-help (eg Alcoholics Anonym ous) may be useful—espe-\\ncially if self-initiated and determined.

Process that we lack the tools to visualize, as cells of the immune system \\ncontinue their onslaught against their perceived enemies, driven by reasons that \\nnone present seem willing to reveal to our crude probing with blood tests, X-rays \\nand biopsies. While the body knows no diseases, only pain and death, our minds \\nattempt to impose a unitary disease on unsuspecting and sometimes innocent cells.\\nFor example, clinically we observe that autoimmune hepatitis (AIH) frequently \\noverlaps with PSC and IBD.

Helps exclude PSC if ALP \\ue000 disproportionately.\\nDiagnosis Depends on excluding other diseases (no lab test is pathognomonic). Di-\\nagnostic crit\\neria based on IgG levels, autoantibodies, and histology in the absence \\nof viral disease are helpful.  Sometimes diagnosis is a challenge —there is overlap \\nwith other chronic liver disease: eg PBC (p282), PSC (p282) and chronic viral hepatitis.\\nTable 6.12 Classifying autoimmune hepatitis: types I–II\\nI Seen in 80%.

Good response to \\nimmunosuppression in 80%. 25% have cirrhosis at presentation.\\nII Commoner in Europe than USA. More often seen in children, and more commonly \\nprogresses to cirrhosis and less treatable. Typically anti-liver/kidney microsomal \\ntype 1 (LKM1) antibodies +ve.

Corticoster-\\noids can sometimes be stopped after 2yrs but relapse occurs in 50–86%. Aza-\\nthioprine (50–100mg/d PO) may be used as a steroid-sparing agent to maintain \\nremission. Remission is achievable in 80% of patients within 3yrs. 10- and 20yr \\nsurvival rates are >80%.  SES are a big problem (p 376)—partly ameliorated by a \\nswitch to budesonide, eg in non-cirrhotic AIH. \\nLiver transplantation: (See p 277.) Indicated for decompensated cirrhosis or if \\nthere is failure to respond to medical therapy, but recurrence may occur. It is ef-\\nfective (actuarial 10yr survival is 75%).\\nPrognosis Appears not to matter whether symptomatic or asymptomatic at \\npr\\nesentation (10yr survival ~80% for both). The presence of cirrhosis at presenta-\\ntion reduces 10yr survival from 94% to 62%. Overlap syndromes: AIH-PBC (primary \\nbiliary cholangitis) overlap is worse than AIH-AIC (autoimmune cholangitis).\\n33 Hepatotropic viruses (eg measles, herpes viruses) and some drugs appear to trigger AIH in geneti-\\ncally predisposed individuals exposed to a hepatotoxic milieu intérieur. Viral interferon can inactivate \\ncytochrome P450 enzymes (\\ue018 \\ue001 metabolism of ex- or endogenous hepatotoxins). Resulting modiﬁ cations to \\nproteins may generate autoantigens driving CD4 T-helper cell activation.\\n_OHCM_10e.indb   284_OHCM_10e.indb   284 02/05/2017   19:0702/05/2017   19:07'),\n",

Imaging: US or CT \\nto identify lesions and guide biopsy. MRI is better at distinguishing benign from ma-\\nlignant lesions. Do ERCP (p742) and biopsy if cholangiocarcinoma is suspected. Liver \\nbiops\\ny: (See p248.)

The gene responsible for most HH is HFE: the 2 commonest \\nmutations are termed C282Y and H63D.

In adults, its lack is more likely \\nto cause emphy  sema. Lung A1AT protects against tissue damage from neutrophil \\nelastase—a process that is also induced by cigarette smoking (p 184). Prevalence \\n~1:4000 (higher in Caucasians).\\nGenetics Genetic variants of A1AT are typed by electro phor etic mobility as medium \\n(M), slow (S), or very slow (Z). S and Z types are due to single amino acid substitutions \\nat positions 264 and 342, respectively. These result in \\ue001production of \\ue0251-antitrypsin \\n(S=60%, Z=15%). The normal genotype is PiMM, the high risk homozygote is Pi ZZ; het-\\nerozygotes are PiMZ and PiSZ (at low risk of developing liver disease).\\nThe patient Symptomatic patients usually have the Pi ZZ genotype: dyspnoea from \\nemphysema; cirrhosis; cholestatic jaundice. Cholestasis often remits in adolescence.\\nTests Serum \\ue0251-antitrypsin (\\ue0251AT) levels \\ue001, usually (eg <11μmol/L or <75% of lower \\nlimit of normal, which is ~0.9g/L; labs vary). Note the ‘usually’. Because A1AT is part of \\nthe acute-phase response, inﬂ  ammation may hide a low level. Unless you do genotyp-\\ning, you will inevitably mis-label some cirrhosis as cryptogenic. Lung function testing: \\nSho\\nws reductions in FEV1 with obstructive pattern (p162). There may be some bronch-\\ndilator reversibility. Liver biopsy: (See p248.) Periodic acid Schiff  (PAS) +ve; diastase-re-\\nsistant globules. Phenotyping: By isoelectric focusing requires expertise to distinguish \\nSZ and ZZ phenotypes. Phenotyping can miss null phenotypes. Prenatal diagnosis: Pos-\\nsible b\\ny DNA analysis of chorionic villus samples obtained at 11–13wks’ gestation.\\nManagement Smok ing cessation. P rompt treatment/preventative vaccination for \\nlung infections. Giving IV A1AT pooled from human plasma is expensive but COPD ex-\\nacerbations may be prevented (no good randomized trials). Liver transplantation:  \\nNeeded in decompensat\\ned cirrhosis. Lung transplantation: Improves survival and \\nhas a compar\\nable survival to transplantation in non- A1AT-deﬁ cient COPD. Inhaled \\nA1AT: Has been tried in lung disease.\\nPrognosis Some patients have life-threatening symptoms in childhood, whereas \\no\\nthers remain asymptomatic and healthy into old age. Worse prognosis if male, a \\nsmoker, or obese. Emphysema is the cause of death in most, liver disease in ~5%. In \\nadults, cirrhosis ± HCC aff ect 25% of A1AT-deﬁ cient adults >50yrs.\\n_OHCM_10e.indb   290_OHCM_10e.indb   290 02/05/2017   19:0702/05/2017   19:07'),\n",

Detected on urine \\ndipstick on repeated testing. Most is not due to renal disease and urological \\ninvestigation is ﬁ rst-line for all those aged >40 years. See p294.\\n  • Asymptomatic proteinuria:  Normal renal protein excretion is less than \\n150mg/24 hours (non-pregnant). Quantiﬁ cation by 24h urine collection is unreli-\\nable and rarely used in clinical practice. A spot urinary protein to creatinine \\nratio (\\nP:CR) >15mg/mmol or urinary albumin to creatinine ratio ( A:CR) >2.5(\\ue032) \\nor 3.5(\\ue033)mg/mmol may signify either glomerular (common) or tubular (rare) \\npathology.\\n  • Abnormal renal function ( GFR): The glomerular ﬁ ltration rate (GFR) is a meas-\\nure of how much blood the kidneys are cleaning per minute. Direct measure-\\nment is invasive and time-consuming. Estimations derived from equations \\nbased on serum creatinine are widely used to give an e\\nGFR (see p669). Errors in \\neGFR are caused by non-steady-state conditions, conditions which alter serum \\ncreatinine (diet, muscle mass), and eGFR is less accurate at higher levels of GFR. \\neGFR is therefore only part of the assessment of renal function.\\n  • High blood pressure: A renal aetiology should be excluded if hypertension oc-\\ncurs with an\\ny indicators of renal disease: haematuria, proteinuria, \\ue001eGFR.\\n  • Electrolyte abnormalities:  Disorders of sodium, potassium, and acid–base bal-\\nance (pp301 and 670–5) may be due to underlying renal disease.\\n2       With r enal tract symptoms\\n  • Urinary symptoms:  Dysuria is a sensation of discomfort with micturition and \\nmay be accompanied by urgency, frequency, and nocturia. UTI is the primary \\ndiff erential. Consider prostatic aetiology if there is diffi  culty initiating voiding, \\npoor stream and dribbling. Oliguria (<400mL/24 hours or <0.5mL/kg/hour) and \\nanuria should trigger assessment and investigation for acute kidney injury \\n(AKI) (see pp 298–301). Poly uria is the voiding of abnormally high volumes of \\nurine, usually from high ﬂ  uid intake. Consider also DM, diabetes insipidus (p240), \\nhypercalcaemia (p676), renal medullary disorders (causing impaired concentra-\\ntion of urine).\\n  • Loin pain: Ureteric colic is severe and radiates anteriorly and to the groin. It is \\ncaused b\\ny a renal stone, clot, or a sloughed papilla. For pain conﬁ ned to the loin \\nconsider pyelonephritis, renal cyst pathology, and renal infarct.\\n  • Visible haematuria: ( VH, macroscopic.) Urological investigation is required to \\nexclude renal tract malignancy. Nephrological causes include polycystic kidney \\ndisease and glomerular disease (\\nIgA p311, anti-glomerular basement membrane \\n(anti-GBM) disease p311, Alport syndrome p320).\\n  • Nephrotic syndrome:  Proteinuria >3g/24 hours ( =P:CR >300mg/mmol) with \\nhypoalbuminaemia (<30g/L) and peripheral oedema. Renal biopsy is usually \\nindicated in adults (p310).\\n  • Symptomatic chronic kidney disease: Dyspnoea, anorexia, weight loss, pruri-\\ntus, bone pain, se\\nxual dysfunction, cognitive decline (pp302–5).\\n3       A s ystemic disorder with renal involvement\\n  • DM: (p314.)\\n  • Metabolic: Sickle cell disease (p 315), tuberous sclerosis (p320), Fabry disease \\n(p320), cystinosis (p321).\\n  • Auto-immune: ANCA-associated vasculitis (p 314, 556), SLE (p 314), Henoch –\\nSchonlein purpura (p 311), systemic sclerosis (p 315), sarcoid (p 318), Sjögren’s \\nsyndrome (p318, 710).\\n  • Infection: Sepsis is a common cause of AKI. Speciﬁ  c renal involvement may oc-\\ncur with TB (p392), malaria, chronic hepatitis (p278), HIV (pp398–403).\\n  • Malignancy : Obstruction, hypercalcaemia, direct toxicity, eg myeloma (p314).\\n  • Pregnancy: Pre-eclampsia, obstruction.\\n  • Drugs used in systemic disorders: NSAIDS, ACE-i, ARB, aminoglycosides, chemo-\\ntherapy.\\n_OHCM_10e.indb   293_OHCM_10e.indb   293 02/05/2017   19:0702/05/2017   19:07'),\n",

Do not attribute haematuria to anticoagulation without investiga-\\ntion. False positive: Myoglobin triggers same dipstick reaction\\n—check microscopy.\\nManagement: VH, SNVH, and aNVH >40yr should undergo urological assessment, im-\\naging, and cystoscopy to exclude renal tract malignancy and calculi.\\nA renal aetiology should be considered, and renal referral made, for \\nNVH with:\\n  • eGFR <60\\n  • coexistent proteinuria (A:CR >30 or P:CR >50)\\n  • hypertension >140/90mmHg\\n  • family history of renal disease.\\nA cause is no\\nt established in 19–68% of patients with NVH.

Systems review: look out for more than is immediately obvious, \\nconsider rare causes, ask about eyes, skin, joints, ask about symptoms suggestive \\nof systemic disorder (‘When did you last feel well?’) and malignancy.\\n  • Curr\\nent state: Patients may have symptomatic CKD if GFR <30. Includes symp-\\ntoms of ﬂ  uid overload (SOB, peripheral oedema), anorexia, nausea, vomiting, rest-\\nless legs, fatigue, weakness, pruritus, bone pain, amenorrhoea, impotence.\\nExamination\\n  • P\\neriphery: Peripheral oedema. Signs of peripheral vascular disease or neuropa-\\nth\\ny. A vasculitic rash. Gouty tophi. Joint disease. Arteriovenous ﬁ  stula (thrill, \\nbruit, recently needling?). Signs of immunosuppression: bruising from steroids, \\nskin malignancy. Uraemic ﬂ ap/encephalopathy if \\nGFR <15.\\n  • F ace: Anaemia, xanthelasma, yellow tinge (uraemia), jaundice (hepatorenal), \\ngum h\\nypertrophy (ciclosporin), Cushingoid (steroids), periorbital oedema (ne-\\nphrotic syndrome), taut skin/telangiectasia (scleroderma), facial lipodystrophy \\n(glomerulonephritis).\\n  • Neck: \\nJVP for ﬂ uid state, tunnelled line (if removed, look for small scar over in-\\nternal jugular, and a larger scar in ‘breast pocket’ area), scar from parathyroid-\\nectomy, lymphadenopathy.\\n  • Car\\ndiovascular: BP, sternotomy, cardiomegaly, stigmata of endocarditis. If \\nright-sided heart failure/tricuspid regurgitation, JVP does not reﬂ ect ﬂ uid state.\\n  • R espiratory: Pulmonary oedema or eff  usion.\\n  • Abdomen: PD catheter or scars from previous catheter (small scars just below \\numbilicus and to side of midline), signs of previous transplant (scar, palpable \\ngraft), ballotable polycystic kidneys ± palpable liver.\\nInvestigation\\n  • Blood: \\nU&E (compare with previous), Hb (normochromic, normocytic anaemia), \\nglucose (DM), \\ue001Ca2+, \\ue000PO4\\n3 Ω, \\ue000PTH (renal osteodystrophy). Directed investigation \\nof intrinsic renal disease: ANA, ANCA, antiphospholipid antibodies, paraprotein, \\ncomplement, cryoglobulin, anti-GBM, hepatitis serology, anti-PLA2R (membranous \\nnephropathy). Note: ESR is not helpful as \\ue000 in CKD and proteinuric states.\\n  • Urine: Dipstick, MC&S, A:CR or P:CR (p294), Bence Jones.\\n  • Imaging: USS for size, symmetry, anatomy, corticomedullary diff erentiation, and \\nto exclude obstruction. In CKD kidneys may be small (<9cm) except in inﬁ ltrative \\ndisorders (amyloid, myeloma), APKD, and DM. If asymmetrical consider renovas-\\ncular disease. Scarring may be seen on USS but isotope scans are more sensitive.\\n  • His tology: Consider renal biopsy (p 310) in progressive disease, nephrotic syn-\\ndrome, systemic disease, AKI without recovery. Biopsy is unlikely to change treat-\\nment if GFR stable and P:CR <150. DM with neuropathy/retinopathy may not need \\nbiopsy unless atypical, ie nephrotic, haematuria, other systemic symptoms. \\nGFR and albuminuria should be monitored at least annually, according to risk. If \\nhigh risk, monitor every 6 months (ﬁ g 7.5, orange), if very high risk, monitor at \\nleast every 3–4 months (ﬁ g 7.5, red). Small ﬂ uctuations are common but a drop in \\neGFR stage with \\ue001eGFR ≥ 25% is signiﬁ  cant. Rapid progression is \\ue001eGFR >5/yr.\\nRisk factors for decline:  \\ue000BP, DM, metabolic disturbance, volume depletion, infec-\\ntion, NSAIDs, smoking.

When transplantation is awaited \\nor not possible, there are two main options: haemodialysis and peritoneal dialysis.\\nHaemodialysis ( HD) (ﬁ g 7.6) Blood is \\npassed over a semi-permeable membrane \\nagainst dialysis ﬂ uid ﬂ owing in the oppo-\\nsite direction. Diff  usion of solutes occurs \\ndown the concentration gradient. A hy-\\ndrostatic gradient is used to clear excess \\nﬂ uid as required (ultraﬁ ltration). Access is \\npreferentially via an arteriovenous ﬁ stula \\nwhich provides \\ue000blood ﬂ  ow and longevity. \\nThis should be created prior to need for \\nRRT \\nto avoid the infection risk associated with central venous dialysis catheters. HD is \\nneeded 3 times/week or more. Daily HD increases the ‘dose’ and improves outcomes. \\nHome HD should be off ered to all suitable patients. Problems: Access (arteriovenous \\nﬁ \\nstula: thrombosis, stenosis, steal syndrome; tunnelled venous line: infection, block-\\nage, recirculation of blood), dialysis dysequilibrium (between cerebral and blood sol-\\nutes leading to cerebral oedema \\ue018 start \\nHD gradually), hypotension, time consuming.\\nPeritoneal dialysis ( PD) Uses the peritoneum as a semi-permeable membrane. \\nA cathet\\ner is inserted into the peritoneal cavity and ﬂ  uid infused. Solutes diff use \\nslowly across. Ultraﬁ ltration is achieved by adding osmotic agents (glucose, glu-\\ncose polymers) to the ﬂ uid. It is a continuous process with intermittent drainage \\nand reﬁ  lling of the peritoneal cavity, performed at home. Problems: Catheter site \\ninf\\nection, PD peritonitis, hernia, loss of membrane function over time.\\nHaemoﬁ ltr ation (ﬁ g 7.7) Water cleared \\nby positive pressure, dragging solutes into \\nthe waste by convection. The ultraﬁ ltrate \\n(waste) is replaced with an appropriate \\nvolume of (‘clean’) ﬂ  uid either before (pre-\\ndilution) or after (post-dilution) the mem-\\nbrane. \\n\\ue001Haemodynamic instability so used \\nin critical car e when HD not possible due \\nto \\ue001BP. Not used for chronic RRT unless in \\ncombination with HD (haemodiaﬁ ltration) \\nfor haemodynamic stability and \\ue000middle molecule clearance, eg \\ue0202-microglobulin.\\nComplications of RRT Annual mortality is signiﬁ cant, mostly due to cardiovascu-\\nlar disease:  \\ue000BP, calcium/phosphate dysregulation, vascular stiff ness, inﬂ ammation, \\noxidative stress, abnormal endothelial function. Protein-calorie malnutrition: In-\\ncr\\neases morbidity and mortality. Renal bone disease:  High bone turno ver, renal \\nosteodystrophy, osteitis ﬁ brosa.

Many will not make the trans-\\nplant list due to comorbidity or frailty.\\nContraindications\\n  • Absolute: cancer with metastases.\\n  • Temporary: active infection, HIV with viral replication, unstable CVD.\\n  • Relative: congestive heart failure, CVD.\\nTypes of graft\\n  • Living donor: Best graft function and survival, especially if HLA matched.\\n  • Deceased donor: (See organ donation p13.)\\n1       Donor after brain death (DBD, heart-beating donor).\\n2       Expanded criteria donor (ECD) is from an older kidney or from a patient with a \\nhistory of CVA, BP, or CKD. This impacts on the long-term prognosis of the trans-\\nplant but off ers a better outcome than remaining on dialysis.\\n3       Donor after cardiac death (DCD, non-heart-beating donor) with \\ue000risk of delayed \\ngraft function.\\nImmunosuppression\\nA combination of drugs are used. Aim is to use the minimal eff ective dose with the \\nlowest drug-related toxicity. Protocol used depends upon the immunological risk of \\nthe recipient and type of donated kidney.\\nMonoclonal antibodies: Eg basiliximab, daclizumab (selectively block activated \\nT cells via CD-25), alemtuzumab (T- and B-cell depletion). Used at the time of trans-\\nplantation (‘induction’). \\ue001Acute rejection and graft loss, \\ue000infection risk if non-selective.\\nCalcineurin inhibitors: Eg tacrolimus, ciclosporin. These drugs inhibit T-cell acti-\\nvation and proliferation. \\ue000Inter-individual variation and narrow therapeutic index \\nmean drug level monitoring is required. Clearance is dependent on cytochrome p450 \\nisoenzymes so beware of drug interactions including macrolide antibiotics and anti-\\nfungal drugs. Side eff  ects: nephrotoxicity in the graft, modiﬁ cation of \\nCV risk factors: \\n\\ue000BP, \\ue000cholesterol, NODAT (new-onset diabetes after transplantation).\\nAntimetabolites: Eg mycophenolic acid (MPA), azathioprine. MPA is now used pref-\\nerentially due to better prevention of acute rejection and graft survival (not in preg-\\nnancy, \\nMPA is teratogenic). Side eff  ects: anaemia, leucopenia, and GI toxicity.\\nGlucorticosteroids:  \\ue001T ranscription of inﬂ  ammatory cytokines. First-choice treat-\\nment for acute rejection. Signiﬁ cant side-eff ects (BP, hyperlipidaemia, DM, impaired \\nwound healing, osteoporosis, cataracts, skin fragility) have led to protocols with ear-\\nly withdrawal of steroids and the use of steroid-free immunosuppression regimens.\\nComplications\\nSur\\ngical: Bleed, thrombosis, infection, urinary leaks, lymphocele, hernia.\\nDelayed graft function: Aff  ects up to 40% of grafts, more common in DCD.\\nRejection: Acute or chronic. Acute is divided into antibody mediated (rare un-\\nless kno\\nwn pre-sensitized recipient) or cellular (most common). Causes \\ue001renal \\nfunction, diagnosed on graft biopsy. Treatment with high-dose steroids and \\n\\ue000immunosuppression. Chronic antibody-mediated rejection causes progressive dys-\\nfunction of the graft. Most graft loss is now thought to be due to an immune re-\\nsponse by donor-speciﬁ c antibodies causing damage to the kidney microcirculation. \\nComplex pathology and lack of controlled studies mean treatment is not clear. The \\nresults of monoclonal antibody trials are awaited.\\nInfection: \\ue000Risk o\\nf all infections.

Proteinuria results \\nfrom podocyte pathology: abnormal function in minimal change disease, immune- \\nmediated damage in membranous nephropathy, and podocyte injury/death in FSGS; \\nor pathology in the GBM/endothelial cell: membranoproliferative GN.\\nPresentation Generalized, pitting oedema, which can be rapid and severe. Look in \\ndependent ar\\neas (ankles if mobile, sacral pad/elbows if bed-bound) and areas of low \\ntissue resistance, eg periorbitally. History: Ask about systemic symptoms, eg joint, \\nskin.

Diuresis with loop diuretics, eg furosemide. \\nIf gut oedema aff ects oral absorption of diuretics, give IV. Use daily weights to \\nguide. Aim 0.5–1kg weight loss per day to avoid intravascular volume depletion \\nand secondary AKI. Thiazide diuretics can be added if oedema remains resistant \\nto high-dose loop diuretics.

This is technically more diffi  cult when there \\nis gross oedema so diuresis may be required ﬁ rst. Treatment known to induce \\nremission should be given, eg corticosteroids in minimal change disease. Look for \\nand treat any underlying systemic disease, infection, or malignancy.\\nIn children, minimal change disease is the commonest aetiology and steroids \\ninduce remission in the majority. Biopsy is therefore avoided in children unless \\nthere is no response to steroids, or if clinical features suggest another cause: \\nage \\n<1yr, family history, extrarenal disease (eg arthritis, rash, anaemia), renal \\nfailure, haematuria.\\n3       R educe proteinuria\\nACE-i/ARB reduce proteinuria (may not be needed in minimal change disease).\\n4       Complications\\n  • Thromboembolism.

Hippocrates ( 460–370BC) ﬁ rst described \\nthe four bodily ﬂ uids, or humours (Latin umor = body ﬂ  uid): blood, phlegm, and \\nyellow and black bile. This is not bile and phlegm as we know it; rather, it was \\npostulated by Fahråeus (1921, the Swedish physician who pioneered the ESR, p372) \\nthat humourism arose from watching blood coagulate in vitro: distilling into layers \\nof bilious yellow serum ﬂ oating on a scurf of white cells, with the dark red-black \\nclot of erythrocytes lurking in the depths of the sample.\\nThese four humours were later elaborated by Roman physician, surgeon, and \\nphilosopher Claudius Galen (c. 129–c.201AD) who attributed physical and behav-\\nioural traits to each humour: sanguine people are warm hearted and conﬁ  dent, \\nthe phlegmatic practical and rational, those with a choleric nature are ﬁ ery and \\npassionate, while the melancholic (melas =black, khole =bile) are depressed yet \\ncreative.1 It was thought that an imbalance of any of these elements was the \\nsource of disease, a belief which led to the wide-scale recommendation of the \\nremoval of the excess bodily ﬂ uid: expectoration, purging, and most popularly, \\nblood-letting. William Harvey, Sydenham, and Dupytren are among the famous \\nnames who celebrated this cure, Harvey stating that ‘daily experience satisﬁ  es \\nus that blood-letting has a most salutary eff ect in many diseases, and is indeed \\nthe foremost among all the general remedial means’. Many tools were devel-\\noped to aid this procedure, notably a collecting bowl with a convenient notch \\nfor the antecubital fossa or neck: the predecessor of the modern kidney dish.\\nSuch was the conviction of the healing brought about by bloodletting that \\n‘haematomania’ reigned despite a suspicious degree of mortality. Indeed, it may \\nhave even killed inaugural US president George Washington in 1799: on develop-\\ning laryngitis he was enthusiastically bled four times by his personal physician, \\nand died 24 hours after symptom onset.\\nEventually, the credibility of this practice waned, and by 1860 it had virtually \\ndisappeared. However, venesection still plays an important role in the manage-\\nment of haemachromatosis (see p288) and polycythaemia rubra vera (p366).\\nA sense of humourism\\nFig 8.2 A normal blood ﬁ lm, with a neutrophil, red cells, and platelets (arrows).\\n©Prof. K Lewandowski & Dr H Jastrow.\\n1 Compare these personalities with those of the 2015 anthropomorphic Pixar ﬁ  lm ‘Inside Out’.\\n_OHCM_10e.indb   323_OHCM_10e.indb   323 02/05/2017   19:0702/05/2017   19:07'),\n",

A low Hb (at sea \\nlevel) is \\n<135g/L for men and <115g/L for women. Anaemia may be due to reduced pro-\\nduction or increased loss of RBCS and has many causes. These will often be distinguish-\\nable by history, examination, and inspection of the blood ﬁ lm (ﬁ g 8.2, p323).\\nSymptoms Due to the underlying cause or to the anaemia itself: fatigue, dyspnoea, \\nf\\naintness, palpitations, headache, tinnitus, anorexia—and angina if there is pre-exist-\\ning coronary artery disease.\\nSigns May be absent even in severe anaemia. There may be pallor (eg of the con-\\njunctiv\\nae, see ﬁ g 8.3, although this is not a reliable sign). In severe anaemia (Hb \\n<80g/L), there may be signs of a hyperdynamic circulation, eg tachycardia, ﬂ  ow \\nmurmurs (ejection-systolic loudest over apex), and cardiac enlargement; or retinal \\nhaemorrhages (rarely). Later, heart failure may occur: here, rapid blood transfusion \\ncan be fatal.\\nTypes of anaemia The ﬁ \\nrst step in diagnosis is to look at the mean cell volume \\n(MCV). Normal MCV is 76–96 femtolitres (1015 fL = 1L).\\nLow MCV (microcytic anaemia):\\n1       Iron-deﬁ ciency anaemia ( IDA), the most common cause: see p326.\\n2       Thalassaemia (suspect if the MCV is ‘too low’ for the Hb level and the red cell \\ncount is raised, though deﬁ  nitive diagnosis needs DNA analysis): see p342.\\n3       Sideroblastic anaemia (very rare): p326.\\nNB: there is iron accumulation in the last two conditions, and so tests will show in-\\ncreased serum iron and ferritin with a low total iron-binding capacity (TIBC).\\nNormal MCV (normocytic anaemia):\\n1       Acute blood loss. 5       Hypothyroidism (or \\ue000MCV).\\n2       Anaemia of chronic disease (or \\ue001MCV). 6       Haemolysis (or \\ue000MCV).\\n3       Bone marrow failure. 7       Pregnancy.\\n4       Renal failure.\\nNB: if \\ue001w cc or \\ue001platelet in normocytic anaemia, suspect marrow failure: see p 364.\\nHigh MCV (macrocytic anaemia):\\n1       B12 or folate deﬁ ciency. 5       Myelodysplastic syndromes.\\n2       Alcohol excess—or liver disease. 6       Marrow inﬁ ltr ation.\\n3       Reticulocytosis (p328, eg with haemolysis). 7       Hypothyroidism.\\n4       Cytotoxics, eg hydroxycarbamide. 8       Antifolate drugs (eg phenytoin).\\nHaemolytic anaemias: These do not ﬁ  t into the above-mentioned classiﬁ  cation \\nas the anaemia may be normocytic or, if there are many young (hence larger) RBCS \\nand reticulocytes, macrocytic (p 332). Suspect if there is a reticulo cytosis ( >2% of \\nRBCS; or retic ulocyte count >100≈109/L), mild macro cytosis, \\ue001haptoglobin, \\ue000bilirubin, \\n\\ue000LDH, or \\ue000urobilinogen. These patients will often be mildly jaundiced (but note that \\nhaemolysis causes pre-hepatic jaundice so there will be no bilirubin in their urine).\\nDoes the patient need a blood transfusion? Probably not if Hb >70g/L. Chronic \\nanaemia in particular can be well-tolerated (though it is crucial to ascertain the \\ncause), and in \\nIDA iron supplements will raise the Hb more safely and cost-eff  ec-\\ntively. In acute anaemia (eg haemorrhage with active peptic ulcer), transfusion for \\nthose with Hb <70g/L may be indicated. Other factors to consider include comor-\\nbidities (particularly IHD) and whether the patient is symptomatic.\\nIn severe anaemia with heart failure, transfusion is vital to restore Hb to a safe \\nlevel, eg \\n60–80g/L, but this must be done with great care. Give it slowly with 10–\\n4 0mg furosemide IV/PO with alternate units (dose depends on previous exposure \\nto diuretics; do not mix with blood). Check for signs of worsening overload: rising \\nJVP and basal crackles: in this eventuality, stop and treat. \\n_OHCM_10e.indb   324_OHCM_10e.indb   324 02/05/2017   19:0702/05/2017   19:07'),\n",

Oral iron, eg ferrous sulfate 200mg/8h PO. SE: nausea, ab-\\ndominal discomfort, diarrhoea or constipation, black stools. Hb should rise by 10g/L/\\nweek, with a modest reticulocytosis (young RBC, p328). Continue for at least 3 months \\nafter Hb normalizes to replenish stores. IV iron is only indicated if the oral route is \\nimpossible or ineff  ective, eg functional iron deﬁ  ciency in chronic renal failure, where \\nthere is inadequate mobilization of iron stores in response to erythropoietin therapy.\\nThe usual reason that IDA fails to respond to iron replacement is that the patient \\nhas rejected the pills —check compliance. Is the reason for the problem GI distur-\\nbance? Altering the dose of elemental iron with a diff erent preparation may help. \\nAlternatively, there may be continued blood loss, malabsorption, anaemia of chron-\\nic disease; or misdiagnosis, eg when thalassaemia is to blame.\\nAnaemia of chronic disease (secondary anaemia)\\nThe commonest anaemia in hospital patients (and the 2nd commonest, after IDA, \\nworldwide). It arises from three problems (in which the polypeptide, hepcidin, plays \\na key role): \\n1  Poor use of iron in erythropoiesis. 2  Cyto kine-induced short ening of RBC \\nsurvival. 3  \\ue001P roduction of and response to erythropoietin.\\nCauses Many, eg chronic infection, vasculitis, rheumatoid, malignancy, renal failure.\\nTests Ferritin normal or \\ue000 in mild normocy tic or microcytic anaemia (eg Hb >80g/L; \\nsee table 8.1). Check blood ﬁ lm, B12, folate, TSH, and tests for haemolysis (p336).\\nTreatment Treating the underlying disease may help (eg in 60% of patients with \\nRA), as may erythropoietin ( SE: ﬂ  u-like symptoms, hypertension, mild rise in the \\nplatelet count and thromboembolism). Also eff  ective in improving quality of life \\nin malignant disease. IV iron can safely overcome the functional iron deﬁ  ciency. \\nHepcidin inhibitors and inﬂ ammatory modulators show promise.\\nSideroblastic anaemia\\nMicrocytic anaemia does not always mean iron deﬁ ciency! 20% of older people with \\nan MCV <75fL are not iron deﬁ  cient. \\ue007Think of sideroblastic anaemia whenever \\nmicr\\nocytic anaemia is not responding to iron.  This condition is characterized by \\nineff ective erythropoiesis, leading to \\ue000iron absorption, iron loading in marrow ± hae-\\nmosiderosis (endocrine, liver, and heart damage due to iron deposition).\\nCauses Congenital (rare, x-linked) or acqui red, eg idiopathic as one of the myelo-\\ndysplastic/myeloprolif erative diseases, can also follow chemotherapy, anti-TB drugs, \\nirradiation, alcohol or lead excess.

Target \\ncells if liver disease; see ﬁ g 8.14, p329 and ﬁ g 8.41, p343.\\nOther tests: LFT (include \\ue034GT), TFT, serum B12, and serum folate (or red cell folate—a \\nmore reliable indicator of folate status, as serum folate only reﬂ ects recent intake).\\nBone marrow biopsy  is indicated if the cause is not revealed by the above tests.

Treat \\nwith f\\nolic acid 5mg/day PO for 4 months, \\ue007never without B12 unless the patient is \\nknown to have a normal B12 level, as in low B12 states it may precipitate, or worsen, \\nsubacute combined degeneration of the cord (p 334). In pregnancy, prophy lactic \\ndoses of folate ( 400mcg/day) are given from conception until at least 12wks; this \\nhelps prevent spina biﬁ  da, as well as anaemia.\\nNB: in unwell patients (eg CCF) with megaloblastic anaemia, it may be necessary to \\ntreat before serum B12 and folate results are known.

B12 helps \\nsynthesize thymidine, and hence DNA, so in deﬁ  ciency RBC production is slow. \\nUntreated, it can lead to megaloblastic anaemia (p332) and irreversible CNS compli-\\ncations. \\ue007  Body stores of B12 are suffi  cient for 4yrs.\\nCauses of deﬁ cienc y • Dietary (eg vegans: B12 is found in meat, ﬁ  sh, and dairy \\nproducts, but not in plants). • Malabs orp tion: during digestion, intrinsic factor ( IF) \\nin the stomach binds B12, enabling it to be absorbed in the terminal ileum. Malab-\\nsorption can therefore arise in the stomach  due to lack of IF (pernicious anaemia, \\npost gastrectomy) or the terminal ileum (ileal r esection, Crohn’s disease, bacterial \\novergrowth, tropical sprue, tapeworms). • Congenital metabolic errors.\\nFeatures General: Symptoms of anaemia (p 324), ‘lemon tinge’ to skin due to \\ncombination of pallor (anaemia) and mild jaundice (due to haemolysis), glossitis \\n(beefy-red sore tongue; ﬁ g 8.27), angular cheilosis (p326).\\nNeuropsychiatric: Irritability, depression, psychosis, dementia.\\nNeurological: Paraesthesiae, peripheral neuropathy. Also subacute combined \\ndegener\\nation of the spinal cord, a combination of peripheral sensory neuropa-\\nth\\ny with both upper and lower motor neuron signs due to \\ue001 B12. The patient may \\ndisplay the classical triad of: • extensor plantars ( UMN) • absent knee jerks ( LMN) \\n• absent ankle jerks (LMN). The onset is insidious (subacute) and signs are symmet-\\nrical. There is a combination of post erior (dorsal) column loss, causing the sensory \\nand LMN signs, and corticospinal tract loss, causing the motor and UMN signs (p446). \\nThe spinothalamic tracts are preserved so pain and temperature sensation may \\nremain intact even in severe cases. Joint-position and vibration sense are often \\naff ected ﬁ rst leading to ataxia, followed by stiff  ness and weakness if untreated. \\n\\ue007The neurological signs of \\nB12 deﬁ ciency can occur without anaemia.\\nPernicious anaemia (PA) This is an autoimmune condition in which atrophic gastritis \\nleads to a lack of IF secretion from the parietal cells of the stomach. Dietary B12 there-\\nfore remains unbound and conseqeuently cannot be absorbed by the terminal ileum.\\nIncidence: 1:1000; \\ue033:\\ue032≈1.6:1; usually >40yrs; higher incidence if blood group A.\\nAssociations: Other autoimmune diseases (p 553): thyroid disease (~ 25%), vitiligo, \\nAddison’s disease, hypoparathyroidism. Carcinoma of stomach is ~3-fold more \\ncommon in pernicious anaemia, so have a low threshold for upper GI endoscopy.\\nTests: • \\ue001Hb. • \\ue000MCV. • WCC and \\ue001platelets if severe. • \\ue001Serum B12\\n4. • Reticulocytes may \\nbe \\ue001 as pr\\noduction impaired. • Hypersegmented neutrophils (p332). • Megaloblasts in \\nthe marr\\now. • Speciﬁ c tests for PA: 1 Parietal cell antibodies: found in 90% with PA, \\nbut also in 3–10% without. 2 IF antibodies: speciﬁ c for PA, but lower sensitivity.\\nTreatment: Treat the cause if possible. If due to malabsorption, give hydroxoco-\\nb\\nalamin (B12) 1mg IM alternate days for 2wks (or, if CNS signs, until improvement \\nstops), then 1mg IM every 3 months for life. If the cause is dietary, then oral B12 \\ncan be given after the initial IM course ( 50–150mcg/daily, between meals). Im-\\nprovement is indicated by a transient marked reticulocytosis (\\ue000MCV), after 4–5 days.\\nPractical hints: • Beware of diagnosing PA in those under 40yrs old: look for GI ma-\\nlabsorption (small bowel biopsy, p266).\\n  • Watch for hypokalaemia due to uptake into new haematopoietic cells.\\n  • Transfusion is best avoided, but PA with high-output CCF may require transfusion, \\nafter doing tests for FBC, folate, B12, and marrow sampling.\\n  • As haematopoiesis accelerates on treatment, additional iron may be needed.\\n  • Hb rises ~10g/L per week; WCC and platelet count should normalize in 1wk.\\nPrognosis: Supplementation usually improves peripheral neuropathy within the \\nﬁ rst 3–6 months, but has little eff ect on cord signs. Patients do best if treated as \\nsoon as possible after the onset of symptoms: don’t delay!\\n4 Serum B12 levels are normal in many patients with subclinical B12 deﬁ ciency. Measuring homocysteine or \\nmethylmalonic acid (\\ue000 if B12 low) may be helpful, but these are non-standard tests.\\n_OHCM_10e.indb   334_OHCM_10e.indb   334 02/05/2017   19:0702/05/2017   19:07'),\n",

It is most commonly seen in people \\nof African origin, and arises from an amino acid substitution in the gene coding for \\nthe \\ue020 chain (Glu \\ue003 Val at position \\n6) which leads to production of HbS rather than \\nHbA (HbA2 and HbF are still produced). Homozygotes (SS) have sickle-cell anaemia \\n(HbSS), and hetero zygotes (HbAS) have sickle-cell trait, which causes no disability \\n(and protects from falciparum malaria). Heterozygotes may still, h owever, experi-\\nence symptomatic sickling in hypoxia, eg in unpressurized aircraft or anaesthesia (so \\nall those of African descent need a pre-op sickle-cell test).\\nPathogenesis HbS polymerizes when deoxygenated, causing \\nRBCS to deform, pro-\\nducing sickle cells, which are fragile and haemolyse, and also block small vessels.\\nPrevalence 1:700 people of African descent.\\nTests Haemolysis is variable. Hb ≈ 60–90g/L, \\ue000reticulocytes 10–20%, \\ue000bilirubin. \\nFilm: sickle cells and target cells (ﬁ g 8.37). Sickle solubility test: +ve, but does not \\ndistinguish between HbSS and HbAS. Hb electrophoresis:  Conﬁ  rms the diagnosis \\nand distinguishes SS, AS states, and other Hb variants. \\ue007Aim for diagnosis at birth  \\n(cor\\nd blood) to aid prompt pneumococcal prophylaxis (vaccine, p167 ± penicillin V).\\nSigns/symptoms Chronic haemolysis is usually well tolerated (except in crises; see \\nBOX ‘Managing sickle-cell crises’).\\nVaso-occlusive ‘painful’ crisis:  Common, due to microvascular occlusion. Often af-\\nf\\nects the marrow, causing severe pain, triggered by cold, dehydration, infection, or \\nhypoxia. Hands and feet are aff ected if <3yrs old leading to dactylitis. Occlusion may \\ncause mesenteric ischaemia, mimicking an acute abdomen. CNS infarction occurs \\nin ~10% of children, leading to stroke , seizures, or cognitive defects . Trans cranial \\nDoppler ultrasonography indicates risk of impending stroke, and blood transfusions \\ncan prevent this by reducing HbS. Also avascular necrosis (eg of femoral head), leg \\nulcers (ﬁ g \\n8.38) and low-ﬂ ow priapism (also seen in CML, may respond to hydration, \\n\\ue025-agonists, eg phenylephrine, or aspiration of blood + irrigation with saline; if for \\n>12h prompt cavernosus–spongiosum shunting can prevent later impotence). \\nAplastic crisis: This is due to parvovirus B19, with sudden reduction in marrow \\nproduction, especially RBCs. Usually self-limiting <2wks; transfusion may be needed.\\nSequestration crisis: Mainly aff  ects children as in adults the spleen becomes \\natrophic. There is pooling of blood in the spleen ± liver, with organomegaly, severe \\nanaemia, and shock. Urgent transfusion is needed.\\nComplications • Splenic infarction occurs before \\n2yrs old, due to micro-\\nvascular occlusion, leading to \\ue000 susceptibility to infection ( 40% of childhood \\nsickle deaths are caused this way). • Poor growth. •  Chronic renal failure. • Gall-\\nst\\nones. • Retinal disease. • Iron overload (see BOX ‘A 7-year-old ...’). •Lung damage: \\nh\\nypoxia\\ue003ﬁ brosis\\ue003pulmonary hypertension.\\nManagement of chronic disease \\ue007Get help from a haematologist.\\n  • Hydroxycarbamide if frequent crises (\\ue000pr oduction of fetal haemoglobin, HbF). Dose \\nexample: 20mg/kg/d if eGFR >60mL/min.\\n  • Splenic infarction leads to hyposplenism and immunocompromise. Prophylaxis, in \\nt\\nerms of antibiotics and immunization, should be given (p373).\\n  • Febrile children risk septicaemia: repeated admission may be avoided by early \\nr\\nescue out-patient antibiotics, eg ceftriaxone (eg 2 doses, 50mg/kg IV on day 0 \\nand 1). Consider admission if Hb <50g/L, WCC <5 or >30 ≈ 109/L, T° >40°C, severe \\npain, dehydration, lung inﬁ ltration. Seek expert advice.\\n  • Bone marrow transplant can be curative but remains controversial.\\nPrevention Genetic counselling; prenatal tests (OHCS pp154–5).

Unmatched \\nglobins precipitate, damaging RBC membranes, causing their haemolysis while still \\nin the marrow. They are common in areas from the Mediterranean to the Far East.\\nThe \\ue020 thalassaemias Usually caused by point mutations in \\ue020-globin genes on \\nchr\\nomosome 11, leading to \\ue001\\ue020 chain production (\\ue020 +) or its absence (\\ue020 0). Various \\ncombinations of mutations are possible (eg \\ue0200/\\ue0200, \\ue020+/\\ue020+, or \\ue020+/\\ue0200).\\nTests: FBC, MCV, ﬁ  lm, iron, HbA2, HbF, Hb electrophoresis. MRI where myocardial \\nsiderosis suspected (from iron overload). \\n\\ue058 thalassaemia minor or trait (eg \\ue058/ \\ue058+; heterozygous state):  this is a carrier \\nstate, and is usually asymptomatic. Mild, well-tolerated anaemia (Hb >90g/L) \\nwhich may worsen in pregnancy. MCV <75fL, HbA2 >3.5%, slight \\ue000HbF. Often con-\\nfused with iron-deﬁ ciency anaemia.\\n\\ue058 thalassaemia intermedia: describes an intermediate state with moderate anae-\\nmia but not requiring transfusions. There may be splenomegaly. There are a vari-\\nety of causes including mild homozygous \\ue020 thalassaemia mutations, eg \\ue020\\n+/\\ue020+, or \\nco-inheritance of \\ue020 thalassaemia trait with another haemoglobinopathy, eg HbC \\nthalassaemia (one parent has the HbC trait, and the other has \\ue020\\n+). Sickle-cell \\ue020 + \\nthalassaemia produces a picture similar to sickle-cell anaemia.\\n\\ue058 thalassaemia major: denotes signiﬁ  cant abnormalities in both \\ue020-globin genes, \\nand presents in the 1st year, with severe anaemia and failure to thrive. Extra-\\nmedullary haematopoiesis (RBCS made outside the marrow) occurs in response to \\nanaemia, causing characteristic head shape, eg skull bossing ( ﬁ gs 8.39, 8.40) and \\nhepato spleno megaly (also due to hae molysis). There is osteopenia (may respond \\nto zoledronic acid). Skull X-ray shows a ‘hair on end’ sign due to \\ue000marrow activity. \\nLife-long blood transfusions are needed, with resulting iron overload/deposition \\nseen after ~ 10yrs as endocrine failure (pituitary, thyroid, pancreas\\ue003diabetes mel-\\nlitus), liver disease, and cardiac toxicity. The ﬁ lm shows very hypochromic, micro-\\ncytic cells + target cells + nucleated RBCs. \\ue000\\ue000HbF, HbA2 variable, HbA absent.\\nTreatment:  \\ue007Promote ﬁ tness; healthy diet. Folate supplements help.  \\n  • Regular (~2–4 weekly) life-long transfusions to keep Hb >90g/L, to suppress the \\nineff ective extramedullary haematopoiesis and to allow normal growth. \\ue007Iron \\no\\nverload is a big problem causing hypothyroidism, hypocalcaemia, and hypo-\\ngonadism. Can be mitigated by iron-chelators (deferiprone PO + desferrioxamine \\nsc twice weekly. SE: pain, deafness, cataracts, retinal damage, \\ue000risk of Yersinia). \\nLarge doses of ascorbic acid can also help by \\ue000urinary excretion of iron.\\n  • Splenectomy if hypersplenism persists with increasing transfusion requirements \\n(p\\n373)—this is best avoided until >5yrs old due to risk of infections.\\n  • Hormonal replacement or treatment for endocrine complications, eg diabetes \\nmellitus, h\\nypothyroidism. Growth hormone treatment has had variable success.\\n  • A histocompatible marrow transplant can off er the chance of a cure. \\nPrevention: Approaches include genetic counselling or antenatal diagnosis using \\nf\\netal blood or DNA, then ‘therapeutic’ abortion.\\nThe \\ue025 thalassaemias ( ﬁ g 8.41) There are two separate \\ue025-globin genes on each \\nchromosome 16 \\ue018 there are four genes (termed \\ue025\\ue025/\\ue025\\ue025). The \\ue025 thalassaemias are \\nmainly caused b\\ny gene deletions. If all four \\ue025 genes are deleted (--/--), death is in \\nutero (Bart’s hydrops ). Here, HbBarts (\\ue0344) is present, which is physiologically use-\\nless. HbH disease occurs if three genes are deleted (--/- \\ue025); there may be moderate \\nanaemia and features of haemolysis: hepatosplenomegaly, leg ulcers, and jaun-\\ndice. In the blood ﬁ lm, there is formation of \\ue020\\n4 tetramers (=HbH) due to excess \\ue020 \\nchains, HbBarts, HbA, and HbA 2. If two genes are deleted (--/ \\ue025\\ue025 or -\\ue025/-\\ue025), there \\nis an asymptomatic carrier state, with \\ue001MCV. With one gene deleted, the clinical \\nstate is normal.\\n_OHCM_10e.indb   342_OHCM_10e.indb   342 02/05/2017   19:0702/05/2017   19:07'),\n",

Disorders of haemostasis fall into these \\nthree groups. The pattern of bleeding is important—vascular and platelet disorders \\nlead to prolonged bleeding from cuts, bleeding into the skin (eg easy bruising and \\npurpura), and bleeding from mucous membranes (eg epistaxis, bleeding from gums, \\nmenorrhagia). Coagulation disorders cause delayed bleeding into joints and muscle.\\n1 Vascular defects Congenital: Osler–Weber–Rendu syndrome (p708), conn ective \\ntissue disease (eg Ehlers–Danlos syndrome, OHCS p642, pseudoxanthoma elasticum). \\nAcquired: Senile purpura, infection (eg meningococcal, measles, dengue fever), \\nst\\neroids, scurvy (perifollicular haemorrhages), Henoch–Schönlein purpura (p702).\\n2 Platelet disorders  Decreased marrow production: Aplastic anaemia (p 364), \\nmegaloblastic anaemia, marrow inﬁ  ltration (eg leukaemia, myeloma), marrow \\nsuppression (cytotoxic drugs, radiotherapy). Excess destruction:  Immune: im-\\nmune thr\\nombocytopenia ( ITP, see BOX ‘Immune thrombocytopenia’), other auto-\\nimmune causes, eg SLE, CLL, drugs, eg heparin, viruses; Non-immune: DIC (p 352), \\nthrombotic thrombocytopenic purpura ( TTP), or HUS ( p315), sequestration (in hy-\\npersplenism). Poorly functioning platelets: Seen in myeloproliferative disease, \\nNSAIDS, and \\ue000urea.\\n3 Coagulation disorders Congenital: Haemophilia, von Willebrand’s disease \\n(p712). Acquired: Anticoagulants, liver disease, DIC (p352), vitamin K deﬁ ciency.\\nHaemophilia A Factor VIII deﬁ  ciency; inherited in an X-linked recessive pattern in \\n1 : 10 000 male births —usually due to a ‘ﬂ  ip tip’ inversion in the factor VIII gene in \\nthe X chromosome. There is a high rate of new mutations (30% have no family his-\\ntory).

This minimizes risk of wrong labelling of samples.\\n  • When giving blood, monitor TPR and BP every ½h.\\n  • Use a dedicated line where practicable (or dedicated lumen of multilumen line).\\nGroup-and-save (G&S) requests Know your local guidelines for elective surgery. \\nHa\\nving crossmatched blood to hand may not be needed if a blood sample is al-\\nready in the lab, with group determined, without any atypical antibodies (ie G&S).\\nProducts2 Whole blood: The only option for the ﬁ  rst 250 years of transfusion \\nhistory, but now rarely used. Red cells: (Packed to make haematocrit ~70%.) Use \\nto correct anaemia or blood loss. 1U \\ue000Hb by 10–15g/L. In anaemia, transfuse until \\nHb ~80g/L. Platelets: (p364.) Usually only needed if bleeding or count is <20 ≈ 109/L. \\n1U should \\ue000platelet count by >20 ≈ 109/L. Failure to do so suggests refractory cause: \\ndiscuss with haematologist. If surgery is planned, get advice if count is <100 ≈ 109/L. \\nFresh frozen plasma (FFP): Use to correct clotting defects: eg DIC (p352); warfarin \\noverdosage where vitamin K would be too slow; liver disease; thrombotic thrombo-\\ncytopenic purpura (p315). It is expensive and carries all the risks of blood transfu-\\nsion. Do not use as a simple volume expander. Human albumin solution is produced \\nas 4.5% or 20% protein solution and is used to replace protein. 20% albumin can be \\nused temporarily in the hypoprotein aemic patient (eg liver disease; nephrosis) who \\nis ﬂ  uid overloaded, without giving an excessive salt load. Also used as replacement \\nin abdominal paracentesis (p\\n765).

T\\nhe preferred option in the prevention and initial treatment of venous thromboem-\\nbolism. Inactivates factor Xa (but not thrombin). t½ is 2- to 4-fold longer than standard \\nheparin, and response is more predictable: only needs to be given once or twice daily \\nSC, and laboratory monitoring is usually not required. See BNF for doses. It accumulates \\nin renal failure: decrease dose for prophylaxis, use UFH for therapeutic treatment\\n2 Unfractionated heparin ( UFH): IV or SC. Binds antithrombin (an endogenous in-\\nhibitor of coagulation), increasing its ability to inhibit thrombin, factor Xa, and IXa. \\nRapid onset and has a short t½. Monitor and adjust dose with APTT (p346).\\nSE for both: \\ue000Bleeding (eg at oper ative site, gastrointestinal, intracranial), heparin-\\ninduced thrombocytopenia ( HIT), osteoporosis with long-term use. HIT and osteo-\\nporosis are less common with LMWH than UFH. Beware hyperkalaemia.\\nCI: Bleeding disorders, platelets <60≈109/L, previous HIT, peptic ulcer, cerebral \\nhaemorrhage, severe hypertension, neurosurgery.\\nWarfarin Used PO OD as long-term anticoagulation. The therapeutic range is nar-\\nrow, varying with the condition being treated (see BOX ‘Warfarin guidelines and \\ntarget levels for INR’)—and eff  ects are reﬂ  ected in the INR. Warfarin inhibits the re-\\nductase enzyme responsible for regenerating the active form of vitamin K, producing \\na state analogous to vitamin K deﬁ ciency. CI: Peptic ulcer, bleeding disorders, severe \\nhypertension, pregnancy (teratogenic, see OHCS p 640). Use with caution in elderly \\nand those with past GI bleeds. In the UK, warfarin tablets are 0.5mg (white), 1mg \\n(brown), 3mg (blue), or 5mg (pink). \\ue007Interactions: p757.\\nDOACS (Direct oral anticoagulants.) Rivaroxaban, apixaban (factor Xa inhibitors) \\nand dabigatran (a direct thrombin inhibitor) do not require regular monitoring and \\ndose adjustment; just a quarterly assessment and annual blood test.  They off er an \\nattractive alternative to warfarin (particularly where monitoring and maintaining \\na therapeutic \\nINR is diffi  cult). CI: severe renal/liver impairment; active bleeding; le-\\nsion at risk o\\nf bleeding; \\ue001clotting factors. Interactions: heparin, clopidogrel.\\nOthers Fondaparinux is a pentasaccharide Xa inhibitor and is used in acute coro-\\nnary s\\nyndrome or in place of LMWH for prophylaxis.\\nBeginning therapeutic anticoagulation (Follow local guidelines, and see BNF.)\\nFor treatment of venous thromboembolism, LMWH or UFH are typically used initially. \\nWhen transitioning to warfarin, give heparin in combination (as early as day 1) and \\ncontinue until INR is in target therapeutic range on 2 consecutive days (see BOX ‘War-\\nfarin dosage’). Start warfarin at 5–10mg given at 18.00 on days 1 and 2, then check INR \\non day 3 (it takes 48–72h for anticoagulant eff ect to develop). Adjust subsequent doses \\naccording to the INR (see table 8.5), which needs to be measured on alternate days until \\nstable, then weekly or less often. When transitioning to a DOAC switch from heparin (ie \\ndo not coadminister DOAC and heparin). DOACS and warfarin may both be initiated as \\nmonotherapy in chronic AF (DOACS also in less extensive thromboembolism).\\nAntidotes If UFH overdose: stop infusion. If there is bleeding, protamine sulphate \\ncounteracts UFH: discuss with a haematologist. Warfarin: see BOX ‘Warfarin dos-\\nage’ and table 8.6.

Avoid \\nunnecessary r\\nectal examinations. Oral hygiene (eg hydrogen peroxide mouth \\nwashes/2h) and Candida prophylaxis are important (p246).\\n  • Check vital signs 4-hrly. High-calorie diet; avoid foods with high risk of microbial \\ncontamination.

Abnormalities are detected in up to 85%, \\nwhich are often translocations. 6 Useful for predicting prognosis, eg poor with \\nPhiladelphia chromosome (p358), and for detecting disease recurrence.\\nSigns and symptoms (ﬁ g 8.49) Due to:\\n  • Marrow failure: anaemia (\\ue001Hb), inf ection (\\ue001WCC), and bleeding (\\ue001platelets).\\n  • Inﬁ ltration: hepato- and splenomegaly, lymphadenopathy —superﬁ cial or medi-\\nastinal, orchidomegaly, CNS involvement—eg cranial nerve palsies, meningism.\\nCommon infections: Especially chest, mouth, perianal, and skin.  Bacterial septi-\\ncaemia, z\\noster, CMV, measles, candidiasis, Pneumocystis pneumonia (p 400).\\nTests • Characteristic blast cells on blood ﬁ lm and bone marrow. WCC usually high.\\n  • CXR and CT scan to look for mediastinal and abdominal lymphadenopathy.\\n  • Lumbar puncture should be performed to look for CNS involvement.\\nTreatment \\ue007Educate and motivate patient to promote engagement with therapy.\\n  • Suppor t: Blood/platelet transfusion, IV ﬂ uids, allopurinol (prevents tumour lysis \\nsyndrome). Insert a subcutaneous port system/Hickman line for IV access. \\n  • Infections: T hese are dangerous, due to neutropenia caused by the disease and \\ntreatment: give immediate IV antibiotics. Start the neutropenic regimen (p352) and \\ngive prophylactic antivirals, antifungals, and antibiotics.\\n  • Chemo therapy: Comple x multi-drug, multi-phase regimens that may take years:\\n  • Remission induction: eg vincristine, prednisolone, L-asparaginase + daunorubicin.\\n  • Consolidation: high-medium-dose therapy in ‘blocks’ over several weeks.\\n  • CNS prophylaxis: intrathecal (or high-dose IV) methotrexate ± CNS irradiation.\\n  • Maintenance: prolonged chemotherapy, eg mercaptopurine (daily), methotrex-\\nate (weekly), and vincristine + prednisolone (monthly) for 2yrs. Relapse is common \\nin blood, CNS, or testis (examine these sites at follow-up). More details: OHCS p194.\\n  • Mat ched related allogeneic marrow transplantations: Once in 1st remission is \\nthe best option in standard-risk younger adults.\\nHaematological remission: Means no evidence of leukaemia in the blood, a normal \\nor r\\necovering blood count, and <5% blasts in a normal regenerating marrow.\\nPrognosis Cure rates for children are 70–90%; for adults only 40% (higher when \\nimatinib/rituximab, p358, are used). Poor prognosis if: adult, male, Philadelphia chro-\\nmosome (p358: BCR–ABL gene fusion due to translocation of chromosomes 9 and 22), \\npresentation with CNS signs, \\ue001Hb , WCC >100≈109/L , or B-cell ALL. PCR is used to detect \\nminimal residual disease, undetectable by standard means. Prognosis in relapsed \\nPh-negative \\nALL is poor (but improvable by marrow transplant). \\nPersonalized treatment \\ue007One size does not ﬁ  t all!  Aim to tailor therapy to the \\nexact gene defect, and according to individual metabolism. Monoclonal antibodies, \\ngene-targeted retinoids, cytokines, vaccines, and \\nT-cell infusions are relevant here.  \\nBiomarkers, eg thiopurine methyltransferase, can predict toxicity from thiopurines. \\n6 Eg t( 12:21) ETV6 -RUNX1 , t( 1;19) TCF3 -PBX1 , t( 9;22) BCR -ABL1 , and rearrangement of MLL .\\n_OHCM_10e.indb   354_OHCM_10e.indb   354 02/05/2017   19:0702/05/2017   19:07'),\n",

It \\nprogresses rapidly (death in ~2 months if untreated; ~20% 3yr survival after \\ue014).\\nIncidence The commonest acute leukaemia of adults ( 1/10 000/yr; increases with \\nage). AML can be a long-term complication of chemotherapy, eg for lymphoma. Also \\nassociated with myelodysplastic states (see BOX ‘Myelodysplastic syndromes’), ra-\\ndiation, and syndromes, eg Down’s.\\nMorphological classiﬁ ca tion There is much heterogeneity (see BOX ‘Heterogene-\\nity in AML’). Four types based on WHO histological classiﬁ cation, cytogenetics, and \\nmolecular genetics:\\n1       AML with recurrent genetic abnormalities.\\n2       AML multilineage dysplasia (eg 2° to pre-existing myelodysplastic syndrome).\\n3       AML, therapy related (in those previously treated with cytotoxic drugs).\\n4       AML, other (not ﬁ  tting above-listed; further subclassiﬁ ed as M0–M7 by maturation).\\nSigns and symptoms • Marr ow failure:  Anaemia, infection, or bleeding. DIC oc-\\ncurs in acute promyelocytic leukaemia, a subtype of AML, where there is release of \\nthromboplastin (p352). • Inﬁ ltr ation: Hepatomegaly, splenomegaly, gum hypertro-\\nph\\ny (ﬁ g 8.50), skin involvement. CNS involvement at presentation is rare.\\nDiagnosis WCC is often \\ue000, but can be normal or even low. Blast cells may be few \\nin the peripheral blood, so diagnosis depends on bone marrow biopsy, immuno-\\nphenotyping, and molecular methods. On biopsy, \\nAML is diff erentiated from ALL by \\nAuer rods (ﬁ gs 8.51– 8.53). Cytogenetic analysis (eg type of mutation) guides treat-\\nment recommendations and prognosis.\\nComplications • Predisposition to infection by both the disease and the treat-\\nment; ma\\ny be bacterial, fungal, or viral —prophylaxis is given for each during ther-\\napy. Be alert to septicaemia (p 352): common organisms present oddly and rare \\norganisms can infect commonly (particularly the fungi Candida and Aspergillus). \\nBe aware that AML itself causes fever. • Chemotherapy causes \\ue000plasma ur ate levels \\n(from tumour lysis)—so give allopurinol with chemotherapy, and keep well hydrat-\\ned with IV ﬂ uids. • Leukostasis (p352) may occur if \\ue000\\ue000WCC.\\nTreatment • Suppor tive care: A s for ALL. Walking exercises can relieve fatigue. \\n  • Chemotherapy: Very intensive, resulting in long periods of marrow suppression \\nwith neutr\\nopenia + platelets \\ue001. The main drugs used include daunorubicin and \\ncyt arabine, with ~ 5 cycles given in 1-week blocks to get a remission ( RAS muta-\\ntions occur in ~20% of patients with AML and enhance sensitivity to cytarabine). \\n  • Bone marrow transplant ( BMT): Pluripotent haematopoietic stem cells are col-\\nlect\\ned from the marrow. Allogeneic transplants from HLA-matched donors (held \\non international databases) are indicated in refractory or relapsing disease. The \\nidea is to destroy leuk aemic cells and the immune system by, eg cyclophospha-\\nmide \\n+ total body irradiation, then repopulate the marrow with donor cells in-\\nfused IV. Ciclosporin ± methotrexate are used to reduce the eff  ect of the new \\nmarrow attacking the patient’s body (GVHD).\\n  • Complications: GVHD (may help explain the curative eff ect of BMT); opportunis-\\ntic infections; relapse of leukaemia; infertility.\\n  • Prognosis: Lower relapse rates ~60% long-term survivors, but signiﬁ cant mor-\\ntality of ~10%. Autologous BMT (where stem cells are taken from the patient \\nthemselves) is used in intermediate prognosis disease, although some studies \\nsuggest better survival rates with intensive chemotherapy regimens.\\n  • Autologous mobilized peripheral blood stem cell transplantation  may off er \\nfaster haemopoietic recovery and less morbidity. \\n  • Supportive care, or lower-dose chemotherapy for disease control, may be more \\nappr\\nopriate in elderly patients, where intensive therapies have poorer outcomes.\\n_OHCM_10e.indb   356_OHCM_10e.indb   356 02/05/2017   19:0702/05/2017   19:07'),\n",

Treatment See BOX.\\nCML is the ﬁ  rst example of a cancer where knowledge of the genotype has led \\nto a speciﬁ cally targeted drug—imatinib, a BCR-ABL tyrosine kinase inhibitor. This \\nhas transformed therapy over the last 10yrs.  Side eff  ects are usually mild: nausea, \\ncramps, oedema, rash, headache, arthralgia. May cause myelosuppression.\\nMore potent 2nd-generation BCR-ABL inhibitors: dasatinib , nilotinib, bosutinib , \\nand ponatinib . Dasatinib and nilotinib allow more patients to achieve deeper, \\nmore rapid responses associated with improved outcomes, and dasatinib has \\nbeen used in imatinib-resistant blast crises (though NICE says that it is often not \\ncost-eff ective). Hydroxycarbamide  is also used.\\nThose with lymphoblastic trans formation may beneﬁ  t from treatment as \\nfor ALL.

Allogeneic transplantation from an HLA-matched sib-\\nling or unrelated donor off ers the only cure, but carries signiﬁ cant morbidity and \\nmortality. Guidelines suggest that this approach should be only rarely used 1st line \\nin young patients (where mortality rates are lower). Other patients should be of-\\nfered a BCR-ABL inhibitor.

Not all centre on nodes (extranodal tissues generating lymphoma include muco-\\nsa-associated lymphoid tissue, eg gastric MALT, later in topic). Incidence has doubled \\nsince 1970 (to 2: 10 000). Causes Immunodeﬁ ciency—drugs; HIV (usually high-grade \\nlymphoma from EBV transformed cells, p405); HTLV-1, p405; H. pylori; toxins; congenital.\\nSigns and symptoms • Superﬁ cial lymphadenopathy ( 75% at presentation).\\n  • Extranodal disease (50%) Gut (commonest): 1 Gastric MALT is caused by H. p ylori, \\nand may regress with its eradication (p252). Symptoms: as for gastric Ca (p 619), \\nwith systemic features (see below). MALT usually involves the antrum, is multifocal, \\nand metastasizes late. 2 Non-MALT gastric lymphomas (60%) are usually diff use \\nlarge-cell B lymphomas—high-grade and not responding well to H. pylori eradi-\\ncation. 3 Small-bowel lymphomas eg IPSID (immunoproliferative small intestine \\ndisease p370), or EATCL (enteropathy/coeliac-associated intra-epithelial T-cell lym-\\nphoma)—presents with diarrhoea, vomiting, abdominal pain, and \\ue001weight. Poor \\nprognosis. Skin: (2nd commonest—see ﬁ g 8.62) Eg clonal T cells in mycosis fungoi-\\ndes (accounts for ~ 50%—p596). Oropharynx: Waldeyer’s ring lymphoma causes \\nsor\\ne throat/obstructed breathing. Other possible sites: Bone, CNS, and lung.\\n  • Systemic features—fever, night sweats, weight loss (less common than in Hodg-\\nkin’s lymphoma, and indicates disseminated disease).\\n  • Pancytopenia from marrow involvement—anaemia, infection, bleeding (\\ue001platelets).\\nTests Blood: FBC, U&E, LFT. \\ue000LDH ≈ worse prognosis, reﬂ ecting \\ue000cell turnover.

Staging: Ann Arbor system (p360)—CT ± PET of chest, abdomen, pelvis. \\nSend cytology of any eff usion; LP for CSF cytology if CNS signs.\\nDiagnosis/management is multidisciplinary, synthesizing details from clinical \\ne\\nvaluation, histology, immunology, molecular genetics, and imaging. Generally:\\n  • Low-grade lymphomas are indolent, often incurable and widely disseminated. In-\\nclude: f\\nollicular lymphoma, marginal zone lymphoma/ MALT, lymphocytic lympho-\\nma (closely related to CLL and treated similarly), lymphoplasmacytoid lymphoma \\n(produces IgM = Waldenström’s macroglobulinaemia, p370). See ﬁ g 8.63.\\n  • High-grade lymphomas are more aggressive, but o ften curable. There is often \\nrapidly enlarging lymphadenopathy with systemic symptoms. Include: Burkitt’s \\nlymphoma (childhood disease with characteristic jaw lymphadenopathy; ﬁ gs \\n8.64, \\n8.65), lymphoblastic lymphomas (like ALL), diff use large B-cell lymphoma.\\nTreatment Huge range of options, depending on disease subtype. L ow grade: \\nI\\nf symptomless, none may be needed. Radiotherapy may be curative in localized \\ndisease. Chlorambucil is used in diff use disease. Remission may be maintained by \\nusing interferon alfa or rituximab (see later in paragraph). Bendamustine is eff ec-\\ntive both with rituximab and as a monotherapy in rituximab-refractory patients. \\nHigh grade: (eg large B-cell lymphoma, DLBCL), ‘R-CHOP’ regimen: Rituximab, Cy-\\nclophosphamide, Hydroxy daunorubicin, vincristine (Oncovin®) and Prednisolone. \\nGr\\nanulocyte colony-stimulating factors (G-CSFs) help neutropenia—eg ﬁ lgrastim or \\nlenograstim (at low doses it may be cost-eff ective).\\nSurvival Histology is important.

In adults, this normally takes place \\nin the central skeleton (vertebrae, sternum, ribs, skull) and proximal long bones. \\nIn some anaemias (eg thalassaemia), increased demand induces haematopoiesis \\nbeyond the marrow (extramedullary haematopoiesis), in liver and spleen, causing \\norganomegaly. All blood cells arise from an early pluripotent stem cell, which divides \\nasymmetrically to produce another stem cell and a progenitor cell committed to a \\nlineage (see ﬁ g \\n8.66). Committed progenitors further diff erentiate into myeloid or \\nlymphocyte lineages, releasing their progeny into the blood.\\nPancytopenia Reduction in all the major cell lines: red cells, white cells, and platelets. \\nCauses ar\\ne due to: 1 \\ue001Marrow production: Aplastic anaemia (see BOX), inﬁ ltration (eg \\nacute leukaemia, myelodysplasia, myeloma, lymphoma, solid tumours, TB), megalo-\\nblastic anaemia, myeloﬁ brosis (p366). 2 \\ue000Peripheral destruction: Hypersplenism.\\nAgranulocytosis Implies that granulocytes ( WBCs with neutrophil, basophil, or \\neosin ophil granules) have stopped being made, leaving the patient at risk of fatal \\ninfections. Many drugs can be the culprit: eg carbimazole, procainamide, sulfona-\\nmides, gold, clozapine, dapsone. \\ue007When starting drugs known to cause agranu-\\nlocy\\ntosis, warn patients to report any fever. Neutropenia (wcc \\ue005 0.5≈109/L) may \\ndeclare itself initially as a sore throat. Stop the drug, commence neutropenic regi-\\nmen and consider \\nG-CSF if indicated (p352).\\nMarrow support Red cells survive for ~120d, platelets for ~8d, and neutrophils for \\n1–2d, so early problems are mainly from neutropenia and thrombocytopenia.\\n1       R ed cell transfusion: Transfusing 1U should raise Hb by ~10–15g/L (p348). Trans-\\nfusion may drop the platelet count (you may need to give platelets before or after).\\n2       P latelets:  Traumatic bleeds, purpura, and easy bruising occur if platelets \\n<50≈109/L. Spontaneous bleeding may occur if platelets <20≈109/L, with intrac-\\nranial haem orrhage rarely. Platelets are stored at room temperature ( 22°C; not \\nin the fridge). In marrow transplant or if severely immunosuppressed, platelets \\nmay need irradiation before use to prevent transfusion-associated \\nGVHD. Platelets \\nmust be ABO compatible. They are not used in  ITP (p345). Indications: • Platelets \\n<10≈109/L. • Haemorrhage (eg DIC, p352). • Before invasive procedures (eg biopsy, \\nlumb\\nar puncture) to increase count to >50≈109/L. 4U of platelets should raise the \\ncount to >40≈109/L in adults; check dose needed with lab.\\n3       Neutr ophils: Use neutropenic regimen if the count <0.5≈109/L (p352).\\nBone marrow biopsy Gives diagnostic information where there are abnormalities \\nin the peripher\\nal blood; it is also an important staging test in the lymphoprolifera-\\ntive disorders. Ideally take an aspirate and trephine usually from the posterior iliac \\ncrest (aspirates can be taken from the anterior iliac crest or sternum). The aspirate \\nprovides a ﬁ  lm which is examined by microscope. The trephine is a core of bone \\nwhich allows assessment of bone marrow cellularity, architecture, and the presence \\nof inﬁ ltrative disease (eg neoplasia). Coagulation disorders may need to be corrected \\npre-biopsy. Apply pressure afterwards (lie on that side for \\n1–2h if platelets are low).\\nThis is a rare (~5 cases per million/year) stem cell disorder in which bone marrow \\nstops making cells, leading to pancytopenia. Presents with features of anaemia \\n(\\ue001Hb), infection (\\ue001\\nWCC), or bleeding (\\ue001 platelets). Causes: Most cases are autoim-\\nmune, trigger\\ned by drugs, viruses (eg parvovirus, hepatitis), or irradiation. May \\nalso be inherit\\ned, eg Fanconi anaemia (p698). Tests: Bone marrow biopsy is diag-\\nnostic. Treatment: Mainly supportive in asymptomatic patients. Transfuse blood \\npr\\noducts as required and initiate neutropenic regimen if count <0.5≈109/L (p352). \\nThe treatment of choice in young patients with severe disease is allogeneic mar-\\nrow transplantation from an \\nHLA-matched sibling, which can be curative. Other-\\nwise, immunosuppression with ciclosporin and antithymocyte globulin may be \\neff ective, although it is not curative in most. There is no clear role for \\nG-CSF.\\nAplastic anaemia\\n_OHCM_10e.indb   364_OHCM_10e.indb   364 02/05/2017   19:0702/05/2017   19:07'),\n",

Agranulocytosis  is when \\nthe Southerly arcs go wrong; thrombocytopenia when the West-pointing arcs go wrong. To the \\nEast we have the lymphocytes  and their B- and T-cell complexities. Anaemia lies in the North of this \\ndiagram. And as for bleeding—how could our predecessors bear to waste a single drop of this stuff  \\non purpose? Our minds are reeling at 175 billion red cells per day—but this is just when the system \\nis idling.

Absolute polycythaemia ( \\ue000RBC mass) is classi-\\ncally measured by dilution of infused autologous radioactive chromium ( 51Cr) lab-\\nelled RBCs. Causes are primary (polycythaemia vera) or secondary due to hypoxia \\n(eg high altitudes, chronic lung disease, cyanotic congenital heart disease, heavy \\nsmoking) or inappropriately \\ue000erythropoietin secretion (eg in renal carcinoma, \\nhepatocellular carcinoma).\\nPolycythaemia vera The malignant proliferation of a clone derived from one \\npluripo\\ntent stem cell. A mutation in JAK2 ( JAK2 V617F) is present in >95%. The \\nerythroid progenitor off spring are unusual in not needing erythropoietin to avoid \\napoptosis. There is excess proliferation of RBCs, WBCs, and platelets, leading to hy-\\nperviscosity and thrombosis. Commoner if >60yrs old.\\nPresentation: May be asymptomatic and detected on FBC, or present with vague \\nsymptoms due to hyperviscosity (p372): headaches, dizziness, tinnitus, visual dis-\\nturbance. Itching after a hot bath, and erythromelalgia, a burning sensation in ﬁ n-\\ngers and toes, are characteristic.

In younger patients at \\nlow risk, this is done by venesection. If higher risk (age >60yrs, previous thrombo-\\nsis), hydroxycarbamide (=hydroxyurea) is used. \\ue025-interferon is preferred in women \\nof childbearing age.

In ~ ⅔, \\nurine contains Bence Jones proteins, which are free Ig light chains of kappa (κ) or \\nlambda (λ) type, ﬁ  ltered by the kidney.\\nIncidence 5/100 000. Peak age: 70yrs. \\ue032: \\ue033 ≈ 1:1.

Lesions are due to \\ue000osteoclast acti-\\nvation, from signalling by myeloma cells.\\n  • Anaemia, neutr openia, or thrombocytopenia may result from marrow inﬁ  ltr a-\\ntion by plasma cells, leading to symptoms of anaemia, infection, and bleeding.\\n  • R ecurrent bacterial infections  due to immunoparesis, and also because of neutro-\\npenia due t\\no the disease and from chemotherapy.\\n  • R enal impairment due to light chain deposition (p 314 & p370) is seen in up to 20% \\nat diagnosis. The light chains have a toxic and inﬂ ammatory eff ect on the proximal \\ntubule cells, but the damage is mainly caused by precipitation of light chains in the \\ndistal loop of Henle. Deposits may rarely be AL-amyloid (causing nephrotic syn-\\ndrome, see p370). Monoclonal immunoglobulins also disrupt glomeruli.\\nTests Bloods: FBC: normocytic normochromic anaemia.

Diagnostic criteria:  \\nSee BOX ‘Myeloma diagnosis’.\\nTreatment Supportive: • Analgesia for bone pain (avoid NSAIDS due to risk of renal \\nimpairment). Give all patients a bisphosphonate (clod ronate, zolendronate, or pa-\\nmidronate), as they reduce fracture rates and bone pain. Local radiotherapy can help \\nrapidly in focal disease. Orthopaedic procedures (vertebroplasty or kyphoplasty) \\nmay be helpful in vertebral collapse. • Anaemia should be corrected with tr\\n ansfu-\\nsion, and erythropoietin may be used. • Renal failure: rehydrate, and ensure adequate \\nﬂ \\nuid intake of 3L/day to prevent further light chain-induced renal impairment. Di-\\nalysis may be needed in acute kidney injury. • Infections: Treat rapidly with broad-\\nspectrum antibio\\ntics until culture results are known. Regular IV immunoglobulin \\ninfusions may be needed if recurrent.\\nChemotherapy: Induction therapy with, eg lenalidomide, bortezomib, and dexa-\\nmethasone. In suitably ﬁ \\nt patients this may be followed by autologous stem-cell \\ntransplantation. In those unsuitable for transplantation, induction therapy is typi-\\ncally continued for 12–18 months, or until serum paraprotein levels have plateaued. \\nTreatment is then typically held until (inevitably) paraprotein levels start to rise \\nagain, at which point further chemotherapy or stem cell transplantation may be \\nconsidered. \\nNB: lenalidomide is a teratogenic immunomodulator which has multiple \\nSE, notably neutropenia and thromboembolism: monitor for sepsis and consider as-\\npirin or anticoagulation if risk \\ue000, eg hyperviscosity or other comorbidities.\\nPrognosis Worse if: >2 osteolytic lesions, \\ue020 2-microglobulin >5.5mg/L, Hb <11g/L; \\nalbumin <30g/L.

It meas-\\nures how far RBCS fall through a column of anticoagulated blood in 1h. If certain \\nproteins cover red cells, these cause RBCS to stick to each other in columns (the same \\nphenomenon as rouleaux, p328) so they fall faster.\\nCauses of a raised ESR Any inﬂ ammation (eg infection, rheumatoid arthritis, ma-\\nlignancy, myocardial infarction), anaemia, and macrocytosis.\\nCaveats •ESR \\ue000 with age. The Westergren method is a rough guide to calculate \\nthe upper limit of normal in older patients: \\n\\ue032: ESR=age  ÷  2; \\ue033: ESR=(age + 10) ÷ 2.\\n•Some conditions lower the ESR, eg poly-\\ncythaemia (due to \\ue000red cell concentration), \\nmicrocytosis, and sickle-cell anaemia. Even \\na slightly raised ESR in these patients should \\nprompt one to ask: ‘ What else is the mat-\\nter?’\\nManagement •In those with a slightly raised ESR, the best plan is probably to wait \\na month and repeat the test. •If the ESR is markedly raised  (>100mm/h), this can \\nhave a 90% predictive value for disease, so such patients should be thoroughly in-\\nvestigated, even in the presence of non-speciﬁ c symptoms. Take a full history, ex-\\namine carefully and consider these tests: FBC, plasma electrophoresis, U&E, PSA, chest \\nand abdominal imaging, ± biopsy of bone marrow or temporal artery.\\nPlasma viscosity (PV)\\nNormal range: 1.50–1.72mPa/s. In many labs, this has replaced the ESR, as it is less \\naff ected by anaemia and simpler to automate. PV is aff ected by the concentration \\nof large plasma proteins and \\ue000 in the same conditions as the ESR—both PV and ESR \\n\\ue000 in chronic inﬂ ammation and are less aff ected by acute changes (unlike CRP, p686).\\nHyperviscosity syndrome\\nSymptoms Lethargy; confusion; \\ue001cognition; CNS disturbance; chest pain; abdom inal \\npain (and sometimes spontaneous GI or GU bleeding); faints; visual disturbance (eg \\n\\ue001vision, amaurosis fugax, retinopathy —eg engorged retinal veins, haemorrhages, \\nexudates; and a blurred disc as seen in ﬁ g 8.76). The visual symptoms are like ‘looking \\nthrough a watery car windscreen’.\\nCauses of high blood viscosity  Very high red cell count (haematocrit >50, eg \\npolycythaemia vera), white cell count (>100≈109/L, eg leukaemia), or plasma compo-\\nnents—usually immunoglobulins, in myeloma or Waldenström’s macroglobulinaemia \\n(p370, as IgM is larger and so \\ue000 viscosity more than the same amount of IgG). Drugs: oral \\ncontraceptives, diuretics, IV IG, erythropoietin, chemotherapy, radio-contrast media.\\nTreatment Urgent treatment is needed which depends on the cause.  Venesec-\\ntion is done in poly cythaemia. Leukapheresis in leukaemias to remove white cells. \\nPlasmapheresis in myeloma and Waldenström’s: blood is withdrawn via a plasma \\nexchange machine, the supernatant plasma from this is discarded, and the RBCS \\nreturned to the patient after being resuspended in a suitable medium.\\nFig 8.76 Hyperviscosity syndrome.\\n_OHCM_10e.indb   372_OHCM_10e.indb   372 02/05/2017   19:0702/05/2017   19:07'),\n",

Special precautions \\nare needed when there is an additional risk factor for thrombosis, eg surgery, preg-\\nnancy, or enforced rest (see BOX for other risk factors). Only ~50% of patients with \\nthrombosis and a +ve family history have an identiﬁ able thrombophilia on routine \\ntests: others may have abnormalities that are as yet unidentiﬁ ed.\\nInherited • Activated protein c (APC) resistance/factor V Leiden: Chief cause o f in-\\nherited thrombophilia. Present in ~5% of the population, although most will not de-\\nvelop thrombosis. Usually associated with a single point mutation in factor V (factor \\nV Leiden), so that this clotting factor is not broken down by APC. Risk of DVT or PE is \\nraised 5-fold if heterozygous for the mutation (50-fold if homozygous). Thrombotic \\nrisk is increased in pregnancy and those on oestrogens (OHCS p33, p257 & p303).\\n• P rothrombin gene mutation: Causes high prothrombin levels and \\ue000thr ombosis \\ndue to down-regulation of ﬁ brinolysis, by thrombin-activated ﬁ brinolysis inhibitor.\\n• P rotein C & S deﬁ ciency: T hese vitamin K-dependent factors act together to \\ncleave and so neutralize factors V & VIII.

Homozygous deﬁ  -\\nciency for either protein causes neonatal purpura fulminans—fatal, if untreated.\\n• Antithr ombin deﬁ  ciency: Antithr ombin is a co-factor of heparin, and inhibits \\nthrombin. Less common, aff ects 1:500. Heterozygotes’ thrombotic risk is greater \\nthan protein C or S deﬁ ciency by ~4-fold. Homozygosity is incompatible with life.\\nAcquired Causes: • Antiphospholipid syndrome (APL: p 554)—serum antiphospho-\\nlipid antibodies (lupus anticoagulant ±  anticardiolipin antibody) predispose to ve-\\nnous and arterial thrombosis, thrombocytopenia, and recurrent fetal loss. In most it \\nis a primary disease, but it is also seen in SLE. • Oral contraceptive pills/HRT (relative \\nrisk 2–4; related to both oestrogen and progesterone content/type). • Any cause of \\nthr\\nombocytosis or polycythaemia may also cause thrombosis (p366).\\nWhich tests? Ask the lab. Do FBC, ﬁ lm, clotting (PT, thrombin time, APTT, ﬁ  brinogen) \\n± APC resistance test, lupus anticoagulant and anticardiolipin antibodies, and assays \\nfor antithrombin and proteins C & S deﬁ ciency (± DNA analysis by PCR for the factor V \\nLeiden mutation if APC resistance test is +ve, and for prothrombin gene mutation). \\n\\ue007These tests should ideally be done when the patient is well, not pregnant, and off  \\nanticoagulation for 1 month.\\nWho? Test those with: • arterial thrombosis or MI at <50yrs old (eg for APL)\\n• unprovoked VTE (ie at <40yrs with no risk factors) • VTE with oral contraceptives/\\npregnancy • unexplained recurrent VTE • unusual site, eg mesenteric or portal vein \\nthr\\nombosis • recurrent fetal loss (≥3) • neonatal thrombosis.\\nWho not? Those already on lifelong anticoagulation, 1st-degree relatives of peo-\\nple with a history of DVT/PE or thrombophilia except in special circumstances. \\n\\ue007There is often no beneﬁ  t to testing (ie no change to management), it is expensive \\nand may cause signiﬁ cant worry to patients: be sparing in requesting these tests.\\nTreatment Anticoagulate acute thrombosis (p 350). If recurrence occurs with no \\nother risk factors, consider lifelong anticoagulation. Recurrence whilst on treat-\\nment should be treated by increasing treatment intensity (eg \\ue000target \\nINR to 3–4). \\nIn antithrombin deﬁ  ciency, high doses of heparin may be needed; liaise with a hae-\\nmatologist. In protein \\nC or S deﬁ ciency, monitor treatment closely as skin necrosis \\nmay occur with warfarin.\\nPrevention Lifelong anticoagulation is not needed in absence of VTE, but advise \\nof \\ue000risk with the oral contraceptive pill or HRT, and counsel as regards to the best \\nform of contraception. Warn about other risk factors for VTE. Prophylaxis may be \\nneeded in pregnancy, eg in antiphospholipid syndrome (get expert help: aspirin \\nand, sometimes, prophylactic heparin are used as warfarin is teratogenic, see \\nOHCS \\np33). Prophylactic SC heparin may also be indicated in high-risk situations, eg pre-\\nsurgery.\\n_OHCM_10e.indb   374_OHCM_10e.indb   374 02/05/2017   19:0702/05/2017   19:07'),\n",

Interactions: Mercaptopurine and \\nazathioprine (\\nwhich is metabolized to mercaptopurine) are metabolized by xanthine \\noxidase (XO).

Failure to meet this deﬁ nition means non-living, dead, dying, or perhaps male. \\nLife is a thing of dynamism, fragility, beauty, danger, and evanescence; gushing \\nforth from a single source. But here the certainties end: what does it really take \\nto be alive? Are viruses and prions living? How many branches are there on our \\ntree? The harder we look, the more complexities we ﬁ  nd. The Hillis plot is a circular \\nphylogenetic tree, and a representation of humanity’s place in nature. We are duly \\nhumbled by this challenge to our imagined self-importance, reminding us that we \\ndo not in reality occupy a privileged position in the hierarchy of the living, just a \\nunique subunit RNA sequence (ﬁ g 9.2).\\nBecause micro-organisms kill our friends we think of them as bad:\\n‘I have no philosophy, nor piety, no art of reﬂ ection,  no theory of compensa-\\ntion to meet things so hid eous, so cruel, and so mad, they are just unspeak-\\nably horrible and irremediable to me and I stare at them with angry and \\nalmost blighted eyes.’\\nHenry James, 1915, describing the death of Rupert Brooke from septicaemia.\\nBut this is a mistake. Kill off   micro-organisms and the whole show ﬁ  zzles out. \\nMicro-organisms gave us the DNA and organelles needed for reading and digesting \\nthis page. Even killing a single pathogen might be a mistake: Sod’s Law will prob-\\nably ensure that something worse will come to inhabit the vacated ecospace. Prod \\none part of the system and events ripple out in an unending stream of unintended \\nconsequences, played out under the stars, which themselves are evolving, and \\nwhich donate and receive our primordial elements.\\nCan we win against infectious diseases? No. But winning or losing is the wrong \\nimage: infectious diseases have made us who we are. All we can do is live with \\nthem. To help us do this in ways that are not too destructive we need robust \\npublic health surveillance, sound vector-control policies, political will, quarantine \\nlaws, openness, and cooperation. Most importantly, do not underestimate the \\nimportance of maintaining our infectious cohabitants in their apparent subor-\\ndinate position. The speed and capacity for learning by ribonucleic malware and \\nsingle-celled organisms is amazing. So do not inadvertently teach them. Preserve \\nyour precious warfare tactics. Expose them to antibiotic therapies only in a \\nstand-off  situation from which they cannot return to ﬁ ght again.\\nWhat is life?\\nFig 9.2 Tree of life based on subunit RNA sequences sampled from ~3000 species out of the 1.7 \\nmillion species that are formally named.

We rely on this for nutrition, functioning vitamin K, anti-inﬂ ammatory \\neff ects, and immune system regulation.\\nBacterial disease results from a breach of the measures that limit bacteria to \\ntheir ‘normal’ roles: skin commensals moved into the bloodstream by a cannula, an-\\ntibiotics altering the commensal microﬂ  ora, immune system evasion or dysfunction \\nallowing organisms to stray beyond their usual boundaries, toxin production. When \\ntreating infections we should therefore remember to look beyond the off ending or-\\nganism and consider what factors may have aided pathogenesis: malnutrition, ‘bar-\\nrier’ breach by cancer/plastic, immunosuppression.\\n\\ue007See ‘Sepsis’, p792.\\nBacteria: Prokaryotic micro-organism without a membrane-bound nucleus.\\nClassiﬁ cation of bacteria: By microscopy and culture of infected samples.\\nInforms antibiotic choice.

Mass production and the ‘golden age’ of antibiotics fol-\\nlowed, with the introduction of a variety of drugs selectively toxic to bacterial, but \\nnot mammalian cells. This is achieved by:\\n  • utilizing a target unique to bacteria, eg cell wall\\n  • selectively targeting bacterial-speciﬁ c components, eg enzymes, ribosomes\\n  • preventing transport of the drug into human cells, eg metronidazole can only be \\ntransported into anaerobic bacteria.\\nThe mechanism of action of diff  erent classes of antibiotic is shown in ﬁ g 9.4.\\nThis spectrum of available antibiotics revolutionized clinical practice and led to \\nthe declaration: ‘It is time to close the book on infectious diseases, and declare \\nthe war against pestilence won’  (attributed in urban legend to Dr. William H \\nStewart, US Surgeon General, 1965–1969). Such conﬁ dence failed to consider that \\nthe capacity for a prokaryotic micro-organism to develop resistance far outstrips \\nthe human capacity to develop new antibiotic drugs.\\nAntibiotic resistance can be:\\n  • Intrinsic: due to inherent structural or functional characteristics, eg vancomycin \\ncannot cross the outer membrane of Gram-negative organisms.\\n  • Acquired: bacteria have been evolving to resist antibacterial agents for billions \\nof years through mutation and/or the transfer of resistance properties. This evo-\\nlutionary phenomenon is accelerated by selection pressure from antibiotic use \\n(including agriculture, aquaculture, and horticulture) which provides a competi-\\ntive advantage for mutated, resistant strains.\\nResistance has emerged for all known antibiotics causing morbidity, mortality, \\nand a huge cost burden worldwide.1 Misadventure is evident. Quinolones are syn-\\nthetic, resistance cannot be acquired in nature, and yet it is epidemic.\\nWhich brings us back to Alexander Fleming who, within 2 years of the mass-\\nproduction of his ‘miracle-mould’, gave this sage warning in his Nobel lecture of \\n1945: ‘Mr X has a sore throat. He buys some penicillin and gives himself, not \\nenough to kill the streptococci, but enough to educate them to resist penicillin. \\nHe then infects his wife. Mrs X gets pneumonia and is treated with penicillin. As \\nthe streptococci are now resistant to penicillin the treatment fails. Mrs X dies. \\nWho is primarily responsible for Mrs X’s death? Why Mr X, whose negligent use \\nof penicillin changed the nature of the microbe.’\\nAntibiotics: action and resistance\\nFig 9.4 Classes of antibiotics and their bacterial cell targets.\\nGlycopeptides\\nVancomycin\\nTeicoplanin\\nPolymyxins\\nColistin 30S subunit\\nAminoglycosides\\nTetracyclines\\n50S subunit\\nMacrolides\\nClindamycin\\nLinezolid\\nChloramphenicol\\nFusidic acid\\nRNA polymerase\\nRifamycins\\nFolate synthesis\\nSulfamethoxazole\\nTrimethoprim DNA synthesis\\nFluoroquinolones\\nMetronidazole\\nCell wall synthesis\\nNucleic acid\\nsynthesis\\nProtein synthesis\\nPABA\\nDHF A\\nTHF A\\n50S\\n30S\\nβ–lactams \\nPenicillins\\nCephalosporins\\nCarbapenems\\n_OHCM_10e.indb   383_OHCM_10e.indb   383 02/05/2017   19:0702/05/2017   19:07'),\n",

Take time to discuss:\\n  • why an antibiotic is not the best option\\n  • alternative options, eg symptomatic treatment, delayed prescribing\\n  • the views and expectations of the patient\\n  • safety-netting advice: what the patient should do if their condition deteriorates.\\n2       Take microbiological samples bef ore prescribing,1 especially for:\\n  • hospital in-patients: review your prescription as soon as MC&S result is available\\n  • recurrent or persistent infection\\n  • non-severe infection: consider if your prescription can wait for MC&S results.\\n3       Follow local guidelines ﬁ rst: best practice is informed by local epidemiology and \\nsensitivities.\\n4       Consider beneﬁ t and harm for each individual patient:\\n  • Allergies: clarify the patient’s reaction—the true incidence of penicillin allergy \\nin patients who report that they are allergic is <10%. In those with a conﬁ rmed \\npenicillin allergy, cross-reactivity with 3rd-generation cephalosporins and car-\\nbapenems is possible but rare (<1%).\\n  • Dose adjust for renal function and weight: use ideal body weight in extremes of \\nBMI (or ideal weight plus a % of excess weight—see local guidelines).\\n  • Check for medication interactions.\\n  • In pregnancy and lactation, see p17.\\n5       Prescribe the shortest eff ective course. Most antibiotics have good oral avail-\\nability. Use IV antibiotics only if in line with local or national (sepsis) guidelines.\\nThen focus:\\nReview the clinical diagnosis and continuing need for antibiotics at 48h for all in-\\npatients and all patients prescribed IV antibiotics:\\n  • Stop antibio tics if there is no evidence of infection.\\n  • Switch from IV to oral whenever possible.\\n  • Change to a narr ower spectrum antibiotic whenever possible.\\n  • Continue regular clinical r eview whilst antibiotics are prescribed.\\nIn England between 2010 and 2014, antibiotic prescribing rose by 4% in general \\npractice, 12% in hospitals, and 32% in other healthcare settings; E. coli resistance \\nto ciproﬂ  oxacin increased by 18%, to cephalosporins by 28%, and to gentamicin \\nby 27%. 25 000 people in Europe die every year from antibiotic-resistant bacteria. \\nEach year ~500 000 develop drug-resistant TB.

Pathogenicity is likely only if there is underlying immune system dysfunction or \\nforeign material (prosthetic valve/joint, \\nIV line, PD catheter, pacemaker).\\nStaphylococcus aureus  is coagulase positive. Presentation:\\n1       Toxin release causes disease distant from infection. Includes:\\n  • scalded skin syndrome—bullae and desquamation due to epidermolytic toxins \\n(no mucosal disease, \\ue001skin loss compared to toxic epidermal necrolysis)\\n  • preformed toxin in food—sudden D&V (p428)\\n  • toxic shock—fever, confusion, rash, diarrhoea, \\ue001BP, AKI, multiorgan dysfunction.\\nTampon associated or occurs with (minor) local infection.\\n2       Local tissue destruction: impetigo, cellulitis, mastitis, septic arthritis, osteomy-\\nelitis, abscess, pneumonia, UTI.\\n3       Haematogenous spread: bacteraemia, endocarditis, ‘metastatic’ seeding.\\nDiagnosis: positiv\\ne culture from relevant site of infection. Treatment: \\ue022Sepsis, see \\np792. Drain infected foci, antibiotic (topical/oral/IV) based on illness severity and risk \\nfactors. Consider local epidemiology of resistance. If systemic treatment indicated, \\nuse \\n\\ue020-lactam whenever possible (may need to cover resistant strains until sensitiv-\\nity available). Preformed toxin in food: supportive, antibiotics not usually indicated.\\nStreptococci:\\nClassiﬁ cation based on Lanceﬁ  eld group persists in terminology (ﬁ g 9.5). Includes:\\n  • Streptococcus pyogenes  (\\ue020-haemolytic group A): colonizes throat, skin, anogenital \\ntract. Range of infection: tonsillitis, pharyngitis, scarlet fever, impetigo, erysipelas, \\ncellulitis, pneumonia, peripartum sepsis, necrotizing fasciitis. All can\\ue003streptococcal \\ntoxic shock \\n= sudden-onset \\ue001BP, multiorgan failure. Post-infectious complications \\nrare: rheumatic fever (p142), glomerulonephritis (p310). Treatment: penicillin.\\n  • Streptococcus agalactiae  (\\ue020-haemolytic group B): neonatal and peurperal infec-\\ntion, skin, soft tissue. Invasive disease (bacteraemia, endocarditis, osteomyelitis, \\nseptic arthritis, meningitis) usually has risk factors: \\nDM, malignancy, chronic dis-\\nease. Treatment: penicillin, macrolide, cephalosporin, chloramphenicol.\\n  • Streptococcus milleri:  if f ound in blood culture look for an abscess—mouth, liver, \\nlung, brain. Treatment: penicillin.\\n  • Streptococcus pneumoniae:  pneumonia (pp166–8), otitis media, meningitis, septi-\\ncaemia. Treatment: penicillin. Vaccination: childhood, hyposplenism, >65y (p407).\\n  • Viridans streptococci: commonest cause of oral/dental origin endocarditis (p150).\\n  • Streptococcus bovis: b acteraemia\\ue003endocarditis. Look for colon/liver disease.\\nStaph. aureus   which produces \\ue020-lactamase, or an altered enzyme responsible \\nfor cell wall formation, will be resistant to \\ue020-lactam antibiotics (penicillins, cepha-\\nlosporins, carbapenems, see p 385). Resistance is usually deﬁ  ned by stability to \\nmeticillin, ie meticillin-resistant Staph. aureus (MRSA). Vancomycin resistance also \\nexists and is classiﬁ ed according to the amount of vancomycin needed to inhibit \\nbacterial growth: vancomycin-intermediate Staph. aureus (VISA) and vancomy-\\ncin-resistant Staph. aureus (VRSA). Resistant staphylococci cause \\ue000 morbidity \\nand mortality compared to sensitive strains. Risk factors for colonization include: \\nantibiotic exposure, hospital stay, surgery, nursing home residence. Treatment of \\ninf\\nection (not colonization): vancomycin (for MRSA), teicoplanin. Oral agents with \\nactivity against MRSA include clindamycin, co-trimoxazole, doxycycline, linezolid. \\nPrevention: surveillance, barrier precautions, hand-h ygiene, decolonization (mupi-\\nrocin 2%, chlorhexidine, tea tree oil), antimicrobial stewardship.

Based \\non a Cochrane review in 2008, which showed reduced complications with os-\\neltamivir, billions were spent stockpiling the drug worldwide.\\nIn fact, the positive conclusion was driven mainly by data from an industry-funded \\nsummary of 10 trials, of which only two had been published.5 Cochrane needed ac-\\ncess to these missing data. The ensuing ﬁ ght for information was to take 5 years. \\nThe off  er of a secret contract, with secret terms, and secrecy about methods, was \\ndeclined. These are not acceptable methods for meta-analysis. Inconsistencies be-\\ngan to arise in conclusions about eff  ectiveness. Were people seeing diff erent data, \\nor was this simply a close call with two sides separated by a very small fence? Either \\nway, being able to see all the data started to become increasingly important. But \\neven the largest phase three trial of the drug had never been published. And was \\nself-reported pneumonia a useful outcome measure? In December \\n2009, Cochrane \\ncould only declare that paucity of data undermined previous ﬁ ndings.\\nThis battle for data became part of ‘Alltrials’: a campaign for transparency in \\nclinical trials. ~50% of all clinical trials remain unpublished. The hunt goes on to \\nﬁ nd them. You can run your own drug trial, choose what to publish, and watch \\nhow the data become skewed at: www.alltrials.net/news/the-economist-publication-bias.\\nAfter half a decade, under ceaseless demand, and with the withholding of data \\nbecome increasingly indefensible, the clinical study reports were released. These \\nare normally used to provide authorities with a detailed trial report. They are not \\neasy fodder for meta-analysis. Assessing \\n160 000 pages was uncharted territory \\nfor Cochrane. And the conclusion: oseltamivir shortens symptoms by <1d and hos-\\npitalization is not reduced. Other complications were unreliably reported.\\nThe WHO includes oseltamivir on its WHO Model List of Essential Medicines  (19th \\nedition, 2015) which means it is considered effi  cacious, safe, cost-eff ective, and a \\nminimum requirement for basic healthcare. Does this stand up to independent \\nscrutiny? The evidence base is certainly tarnished.

This leads to progressive immune system dysfunction, opportun-\\nistic infection, and malignancy = Acquired Immunodeﬁ ciency Syndrome (AIDS). The \\nvirus is transmitted via blood, sexual ﬂ  uids, and breast milk. Virus subtypes include \\nHIV1 (global epidemic) and HIV2 (\\ue001 pathogenic, predominantly West Africa).\\nEpidemiology\\n~37 million adults and children are estimated to be living with HIV worldwide (ﬁ g \\n9.11), with 1.2 million deaths/yr. Africa has most of the disease ( ~26 million), most \\nof the mortality (790 000/yr), and ~1% of the world’s wealth.\\nUK: estimated ~100 000 living with HIV (=1.9/1000) including 5% of men who have sex \\nwith men (MSM). ~17% of those with HIV in UK are unaware of their infection.\\nPathophysiology\\nHIV binds, via its GP120 envelope glycoprotein, to CD4 receptors on helper T cells, \\nmonocytes, and macrophages. These ‘ CD4 cells’ migrate to lymphoid tissue where \\nthe virus replicates, producing billions of new virions. These are released, and in turn \\ninfect new CD4 cells. As infection progresses, depletion or impaired function of CD4 \\ncells leads to \\ue001immune function. HIV is a retrovirus: it encodes reverse transcriptase, \\nallowing DNA copies to be produced from viral RNA. This is error prone, meaning a \\nsigniﬁ cant mutation rate, which contributes to treatment resistance.\\nPrevention\\nSexual tr ansmission: Consistent and correct use of (male and female) condoms \\n\\ue001 transmission by ~90%. Serosorting is the restriction of (unprotected) sex depend-\\ning on HIV status. It is unsafe due to inaccuracies in HIV status (which is only as \\nreliable as a person’s last test) and failure to disclose. It does not consider transfer of \\ntreatment resistance, other STIs, or hepatitis.\\nPost-exposure prophylaxis (PEP): The short-term use of antiretroviral therapy (ART) \\nafter potential HIV exposure (sexual or occupational) should be considered an emer-\\ngency method of HIV prevention. Can be given up to 72h (ideally <24h) after exposure. \\nNot recommended if exposure is to a person on ART with a conﬁ rmed and sustained \\n(>6 months) undetectable (<200 copies/mL) viral load. 1st-line PEP6 in UK is Truvada® \\n(tenofovir/emtricitabine) and raltegravir for 28 days (2015) (refer to local guidelines). \\nTest for HIV 8–12 weeks after exposure.\\nPre-exposure prophylaxis (PrEP): The use of ART in those at high risk of acquiring HIV \\nincluding serodiff erent relationships without suppression of viral load, condomless \\nanal sex in MSM. Trials (PROUD, IPERGAY) show an 86% reduction in HIV incidence. A \\nlarge scale trial of PrEP provision (2017–2020) will inform future NHS funding decisions.\\nVertical transmission:  All pregnant women with HIV should have commenced ART \\nby 24 weeks’ gestation. Caesarean delivery indicated if viral load >50 copies/mL. \\nNeonatal PEP is given from birth to 4wks old with formula-feeding.\\nFig 9.11 Adult HIV prevalence (15–49 years).\\nReproduced with permission from World Health Organization, ‘Adult HIV prevalence (15–49 years), 2015 by \\nWHO region’. ©World Health Organization 2016.\\nhttp://gamapserver.who.int/mapLibrary/Files/Maps/HIV_adult_prevalence_2015.png.\\n_OHCM_10e.indb   398_OHCM_10e.indb   398 02/05/2017   19:0702/05/2017   19:07'),\n",

UTI is the most common \\ninfection acquired as a result of healthcare, accounting for 19% of all healthcare-\\nassociated infection. ~50% of UTIS are associated with a urethral catheter. Risk of \\ninfection is related to method of catheter insertion, duration of catheter, quality of \\ncatheter care, and patient susceptibility.\\nTo reduce risk, only catheterize if necessary: Is there obstruction?

Consider in all \\ndiarrhoea associated with antibiotic use, especially if marked neutrophilia.\\nDiagnosis:  Immunoassay for glutamate dehydrogenase (common antigen) de-\\ntects all strains of C. difﬁ cile. Detection of toxin (toxin immunoassay, toxin gene \\nnucleic acid ampliﬁ cation) distinguishes infection from carriage.\\nManagement: SIGHT: Suspect, Isolate within 2h, Gloves and aprons, Hand wash \\nwith soap, Test immediately.\\n  • Mild/moderate: metronidazole PO.\\n  • Severe (WCC >15≈109/L or AKI or colitis or temperature >38.5oC): vancomycin PO \\n(injection preparation can be given orally and is cheaper than capsules) or fidax-\\nomicin (\\ue000cost).\\n  • Non-responders: high-dose vancomycin+IV metronidazole, fidaxomicin, IV immu-\\nnoglubulin (no RCT data).\\n  • Recurrence: (weaning) vancomycin, ﬁ daxomicin, faecal transplantation.\\nClostridium difﬁ cile\\nFig 9.22 Areas commonly missed when \\nwashing hands.\\nContains public sector information licensed \\nunder Open Government Licence v3.0, www.\\nwhatdotheyknow.com/request/21861/response/56086/\\nattach/3/04072 Hand Hygiene 5 1.1.pdf\\n_OHCM_10e.indb   411_OHCM_10e.indb   411 02/05/2017   19:0702/05/2017   19:07'),\n",

If a dormant stage \\nexists (vivax, ovale, see table \\n9.19), and is inadequately treat-\\ned, merozoites can be released \\nfrom the liver weeks, months, \\nor years later causing recurrent \\ndisease. The rupture of schizonts \\nreleases merozoites which enter \\nRBCs (‘what a fantastic niche!’ ). In the RBC, merozoites form larger trophozoites and \\nerthrocytic schizonts (poor prognostic indicator if seen on blood ﬁ lm). The rupture of \\nerthrocytic schizonts produces the clinical manifestations of malaria.\\nClinical features\\n\\ue007Consider in anyone with a fever who has previously visited a malarial area (ﬁ g 9.23), \\nregardless of prophylaxis.\\nPresentation: P. falciparum has a minimum incub ation o\\n f 6 days and most com-\\nmonly occurs within 3 months of return from an endemic area.

Fe-\\nver patterns are described but only occur if rupture of infected \\nRBCs is synchronized: \\nalternate day for P. falciparum, P. vivax, P. ovale (‘tertian’) ; every 3rd day for P. \\nmalariae (‘quartan’). \\ue007Most patients have no speciﬁ c f ever pattern.\\nExamination: Fever, otherwise unremarkable.

Caring, light-hearted, intense, profane. In 2013, he ex-\\npressed his greatest worry: an epidemic of VHF. A well-founded fear which would \\nultimately prove prophetic, in a hospital with a shortage of personnel, rationing of \\ngloves, and limited soap. Universal precautions? Unaff  ordable, and not even close.\\nHe was also a coff  ee farmer. But not for him a deserved retirement to his planta-\\ntion, surrounded by photographs of \\n8 children, 6 adopted children, and grand-\\nchildren to match. Unprotected, despite a lucky fedora and a gallows sense of \\nhumour, he contracted Ebola in \\n2014 at the age of 74 whilst manning the front line \\nof the world’s deadliest VHF epidemic to date.

Transmitted by the bite of infected \\nblack ﬂ ies which breed in fast-ﬂ  owing rivers and streams. Second most com-\\nmon infectious cause of blindness worldwide: predominantly sub-Saharan Africa, \\nBrazil, Venezuela, Yemen. Presentation:  A nodule forms at the site of the bite \\nwhere larvae mature to adult worms. The female adult can release up to 1000 \\nmicroﬁ lariae/day causing:\\n  • skin disease: altered pigment ation, licheniﬁ cation, loss of elasticity, poor healing\\n  • eye disease: keratitis, uveitis, cataract, ﬁ  xed pupil, fundal degeneration, optic \\nneuritis/atrophy, visual impairment/loss (ﬁ g 9.51)\\n  • impaired lymphatic function: lymphadenopathy, elephantiasis.\\nDiagnosis:  Visualization of microﬁ laria in eye or on skin snip biopsy: a ﬁ ne shav-\\ning of clean skin is incubated in 0.9% saline to allow microﬁ lariae to emerge for \\nmicroscopic identiﬁ cation. Serology. Treatment: Ivermectin 150mcg/kg, one dose \\nevery 3–12 months (depending on likely re-exposure). CI if coexisting Loa-Loa due \\nto risk of fatal encephalitic reaction. Or 6wk doxycycline. No vaccine available.\\nLoiasis (African eye-worm)\\nCaused by parasitic worm Loa loa. Transmitted via bite of deerﬂ ies (=mangrove/\\nmango ﬂ ies) which breed in rainforests of west and central Africa. Presenta-\\ntion: Recurrent pruritic lesions due to angioedema (‘Calabar swellings’), myalgia, \\narthralgia. The adult worm can migrate through subcutaneous (ﬁ g 9.52) and sub-\\nconjunctival (ﬁ g 9.53) tissue: ‘Something’s wiggling in my eye, doctor’. This eerie \\neye trip causes intense conjunctivitis, which heals  if left alone. (Don’t treat until \\ntransmigration in the eye is over: on detecting your therapy the worm tends to \\npanic.) Also causes glomerulonephritis, and encephalitis. Diagnosis  : Microﬁ lar-\\niae on blood smear, serology, PCR. Eosinophilia. Treatment: Diethylcarbamazine \\n(DEC) kills both microﬁ lariae and adult worms.

Consider all de-\\ntails as potentially relevant. Include: travel (p 414), diet, animal contact, changes in \\nmedication, recreational drug use, obstetric/sexual history, family history (table 9.30).\\nExamination\\nConﬁ \\nrm fever. Pattern of fever is rarely helpful (contrary to the textbooks, most ma-\\nlaria has no speciﬁ c pattern). Do not forget: mouth, genitals, skin, thyroid, lymphatic \\nsystem, eyes including retina, temporal arteries (table 9.30).\\nInvestigation\\n\\ue007Extent of investigation depends on immune status and how well the patient is.\\n  • Blood t\\nests: FBC, U&E, LFT, CRP, ESR, electrophoresis, LDH, CK, ANA, ANCA, rheumatoid fac-\\ntor, HIV test, malaria smear, interferon-gamma release assay for TB (p394).\\n  • Microscopy and culture:  Blood ≈3, urine, sputum (including AFB), stool, CSF.\\n  • Imaging: CXR, abdominal/pelvic USS, venous Doppler. Consider: CT(PA), MRI, echo (TOE). \\nFluorodeoxyglucose-PET (FDG-PET) highlights areas of \\ue000glucose uptake including tu-\\nmour and inﬂ ammation.

Perhaps the \\norganism is ‘fastidious’ in its nutritional requirement or requires a longer incuba-\\ntion? Even if culture is achieved, it may be that the organism grown is ﬂ ora not \\npathogen.

Our ability to be self-aware, to think, and to reason has formed \\nthe basis of scientiﬁ c inquiry and philosophical speculation for millennia, as we \\nattempt to rationalize and deﬁ  ne this cognitive capability. What is the mind? \\nLess tangible than other aspects of our being, throughout time humans have \\nlooked to explanations from philosophy, folklore, religion, and now science. The \\nconcept of the sense of self and being that deﬁ  nes us a¬¬\\n—whether it be called \\nthe ego, nous, or the soul —remains intriguing yet elusive to explain. Aristotle \\nheld that the psyche (Greek: ψυχή=soul) was not separate to its housing body, \\nas one could not exist without the other. This view was directly contradicted by \\nthe \\n17th-century French philosopher René Descartes. He proposed the theory of \\n‘mind–body dualism’ in which the mind, located in the pineal gland, is an entirely \\nseparate entity to the material being, and controls the avatar of the physical \\nbody like a puppeteer.\\nThese conﬂ icting viewpoints well illustrate the spectrum of neurological disease \\nand its blurred boundaries with psychiatry and psychology. Jean Martin Charcot \\n(\\n1825–1893), often credited as the father of neurology, appeared to be more inter-\\nested in this crossover than neuronal dysfunction: he spent two decades of his \\ncareer studying hysteria in Paris, initially attributing symptoms of crying, fainting, \\nand temporary blindness to an organic, inherited cause, before revising his view \\nin later life to conclude that this was a psychological disease. His controversial \\nwork in this ﬁ  eld inspired his student Sigmund Freud’s psychoanalytical theories, \\nand illustrated the very real power of the conscious, or sub-conscious, to produce \\nphysical symptoms, a phenomenon familiar to all physicians. Perhaps reﬂ ecting \\nour frustration with this challenging area as much as his limited success, we re-\\nmember Charcot for his more tangible outputs, for example, in giving the inau-\\ngural description of, among other things, multiple sclerosis, Parkinson’s disease, \\namyotrophic lateral sclerosis (\\nALS), Charcot–Marie–Tooth disease, and of course \\nhis eponymous misshapen joint resulting from proprioceptive loss.\\nHowever, both Aristotle and Charcot would have surely agreed with Descartes’ \\nproposition of ‘cogito ergo sum’: I think, therefore I am. Whether mind and brain \\nare dual or one, they are inextricably linked and the very nature of awareness \\nproves its existence. \\nI think, therefore I am\\n_OHCM_10e.indb   445_OHCM_10e.indb   445 02/05/2017   19:0802/05/2017   19:08'),\n",

Locating a focal le-\\nsion can be aided by features such as asymmetry (eg one pupil dilated, one upgoing \\nplantar response) or a spinal level (eff ects may be symmetrical below the lesion). \\n\\ue007Note that sometimes there is no single lesion, rather, a gener al insult causing a \\nfalsely localizing sign, eg abducens nerve palsy in \\ue000 ICP. Other generalized causes of \\nspeciﬁ c local eff  ects are: trauma, encephalitis, anoxia, poisoning, or post-ictal states.\\nPatterns of loss Are crucial in locating the lesion (see BOX ‘From ﬁ  ndings to neu-\\nroanatomy’):\\nUpper motor neuron  (UMN): Patterns of weakness are caused by damage anywhere \\nalong the corticospinal (=pyramidal) tracts: pathways that carry motor information \\nfrom the precentral gyrus of the frontal cortex up to the synapse with anterior horn \\ncells in the spinal cord (via the internal capsule, brainstem, and cord).\\n1 •UMN weakness \\naff ects groups rather than individual muscles, typically in a ‘pyramidal’ pattern: in \\nthe arm, extensors are predominantly aff ected; in the leg the opposite is true and \\nthe ﬂ  exors are the weaker muscle group. •Spasticity de velops in the stronger muscle \\ngroups (arm ﬂ exors and leg extensors). It manifests as \\ue000 tone that is velocity-de-\\npendent, ie the faster you move the patient’s muscle, the greater the resistance, until \\nit ﬁ  nally gives way (like a ‘clasp-knife’).2 •Muscle wasting is less prominent. • There is \\nh\\nyperreﬂ exia: reﬂ exes are brisk. • Plantars are upgoing (+ve Babinski sign) ± clonus \\n(elicited by rapidly dorsi ﬂ exing the foot; ≤3 rhythmic, downward beats of the foot are \\nnormal). •Loss of skilled ﬁ ne ﬁ  nger move ments may be greater than expected from \\nthe overall grade of weakness (see BOX ‘Muscle weakness grading’). \\ue007UMN lesions can \\nmimic LMN lesions in the ﬁ rst few hours before spasticity and hyperreﬂ exia develop.\\nLower motor neuron (LMN): Lesions are caused by damage anywhere from the ante-\\nrior horn cells distally, including the nerve roots, plexuses, and peripheral nerves. The \\npattern of weakness corresponds to the muscles supplied by the involved neurons. \\n•Aff \\nected muscles show wasting ± fasciculation (spontaneous  involuntary twitching). \\n•There is h ypotonia/ﬂ  accidity: the limb feels soft and ﬂ  oppy, providing little resistance \\nto passive stretch. •Reﬂ exes are reduced or absent; the plantars  remain ﬂ exor. \\ue007The \\nchief diff er\\nential for LMN weakness is a primary muscle disease (p510)—but here there \\nis symmetrical loss, reﬂ exes are normal or lost late, and there is no sensory component.\\nMixed LMN and UMN signs: Can occur, eg in MND, \\ue001B12, taboparesis (see p466).\\nSensory deﬁ cits: It is important to test individual modalities and remember the \\nquirks o\\nf our normal wiring: correctly interpreted, the distribution of sensory loss \\nand the modality involved (pain, T°, touch, vibration, joint-position sense) will help \\nreﬁ ne and increase your conﬁ  dence in localizing the lesion (see BOX ‘From ﬁ ndings \\nto neuroanatomy’). Pain and T° sensations travel along small ﬁ  bres in peripheral \\nnerves and the anterolateral (spinothalamic) tracts in the cord and brainstem \\n(p516), whereas joint-position and vibration sense travel in large ﬁ bres in peripheral \\nnerves and the large dorsal columns of the cord.\\n1 Most of the ﬁ bres of the corticospinal (=pyramidal) tract decussate at the medullary pyramids, hence the \\nname and the contralateral nature of symptoms. Extrapyramidal denotes damage to the basal ganglia and \\npresents as parkinsonism (see p468, 494).\\n2 Whereas with rigidity, \\ue000 tone is not velocity-dependent but constant throughout passive movement.\\n •Grade 0 No muscle contraction  •Grade 3 Active movement against gravity\\n •Grade 1 Flicker of contraction  •Grade 4 Active movement against resistance\\n •Grade 2 Some active movement  •Grade 5 Normal power (allowing for age) \\nGrade 4 covers a big range: 4Ω, 4, and 4+ denote movement against slight, moder-\\nate, and stronger resistance; avoid fudging descriptions —‘stren gth 4/5 through-\\nout’ suggests a mild quadriparesis or myopathy.

Sensory loss may be \\nconﬁ ned to discriminative functions, eg stereognosis and two-point discrimina-\\ntion (p499). Internal capsule (p 470) and corticospinal tract lesions cause con-\\ntr\\nalateral hemiparesis (UMN signs). There is generalized contralateral sensory loss. \\nA cranial nerve palsy (III–XII) contralateral to a hemipl egia implicates the brain-\\ns\\ntem on the side of the cranial nerve palsy. Lateral brainstem lesions show both \\ndissociat\\ned and crossed sensory loss with pain and T° loss on the side of the face \\nipsilateral to the lesion, and contralateral arm and leg sensory loss. Cord lesions  \\ncausing par\\naparesis (both legs) or quadriparesis/tetra plegia (all limbs) are sug-\\ngested by ﬁ nding a motor and reﬂ ex level (power is unaff  ected above the lesion, \\nwith LMN signs at the level of the lesion, and UMN signs below the lesion). A sensory \\nlevel is the hallmark (albeit a rather unreliable one)—ie decreased sensation below \\nthe level of the lesion with normal sensation above. Hemi- cord lesions cause a \\nBrown-Séquard picture (p696): dorsal column loss on the side of the lesion and \\ncontralateral spinothalamic loss. Dissociated sensory loss may occur, eg in cervi-\\ncal cord lesions —loss of ﬁ ne touch and proprioception without loss of pain and \\ntemperature (or vice versa, eg syringomyelia, p516; or cord tumours). Peripheral \\nneur\\nopathies: (p502.) Most cause distal weakness, eg foot-drop; weak hand (note: \\nalthough Guillain–Barré syndrome typically presents as distal weakness that as-\\ncends over time, some atypical forms of Guillain –Barré syndrome may present \\nwith proximal weakness due to nerve root involvement). Sensory loss is typically \\nworse distally (may involve all sensory modalities or be selective, depending on \\nnerve ﬁ bre size involved). Involvement of a single nerve (mononeuropathy) occurs \\nwith trauma or entrapment (carpal tunnel, p\\n503); invol vement of several nerves \\n(mononeuritis multiplex) is seen, eg in DM or vasculitis. Sensory loss from indi-\\nvidual nerve lesions will follow anatomical territories (dermatomes, p454), which \\nare usually more sharply deﬁ  ned than those of root lesions.\\nAlso ask\\nWhat is the lesion? Are the cells diseased, dysfunctional, disconnected (after a \\nstr\\noke), or under- or overexcited (migraine; epilepsy)? Is there loss of a speciﬁ c type \\nof nerve cell, as in MND or subacute com bined degeneration of the cord (\\ue001B12, p334). \\nArteriopaths get strokes, tropical travellers get wormy lesions.\\nWhy? Is there a systemic disease causing the neurology? Eg atrial ﬁ  brillation \\nallo\\nwing an embolus to form, which then lodges in the patient’s dominant hemi-\\nsphere, causing an infarct that presents with dysphasia.

Always try to identify the area \\nof brain that correlates with a patient’s symptoms and identify the aff ected artery.\\nInternal carotid arteries Supply the majority of blood to the anterior two-thirds of \\nthe cer\\nebral hemispheres and the basal ganglia (via the lenticulo striate arteries). At \\nworst, internal carotid artery occlusion causes fatal total  infarction of these areas. \\nMore often, the picture is like middle cerebral artery occlusion (see later in topic).\\nThe circle of Willis (ﬁ g 10.2) An anastomotic ring at the base of the brain fed by the \\nthr\\nee arteries that supply the brain with blood: the internal carotids (anteriorly) and \\nthe basilar artery (posteriorly, formed by the joining of     the vertebral arteries, which \\nsupply the brainstem). This arrangement may compensate for the eff  ects of occlusion \\nof a feeder vessel by allowing supply from unaff  ected vessels; however, the anatomy of \\nthe circle of Willis is variable and in many people it does not provide much protection.\\nCerebral arteries Three pairs of arteries leave the circle of Willis to supply the \\ncer\\nebral hemispheres: the anterior, middle, and posterior cerebral arteries (ﬁ gs 10.2, \\n10.3). The anterior and middle cerebrals are branches of the internal carotid arteries; \\nin 80%, the basilar artery divides into the two posterior cerebral arteries. Ischaemia \\nfrom occlusion of any one of them may be lessened by retrograde supply from lep-\\ntomeningeal vessels.\\nAnterior cerebral artery: (ﬁ  g \\n10.2) Supplies the frontal and medial part of the \\ncerebrum.

Bilateral infarction is a rare cause of paraplegia \\nand an even rarer cause of akinetic mutism.\\nMiddle cerebral artery: (ﬁ g \\n10.2) Supplies the lateral part of each hemisphere. Oc-\\nclusion may cause contralateral hemiparesis, hemisensory loss (esp. face and arm), \\ncontralateral homonymous hemianopia due to involvement of the optic radiation, \\ncognitive change including dysphasia with dominant hemisphere lesions, and visuo-\\nspatial disturbance (eg cannot dress; gets lost) with non-dominant lesions.\\nPosterior cerebral artery: ( ﬁ gs \\n10.2, 10.4) Supplies the occipital lobe. Occlusion \\ngives contralateral homon ymous hemianopia (often with macula sparing).\\nVertebrobasilar circulation Supplies the cerebellum, brainstem, occipital lobes; \\nocclusion causes signs r\\nelating to any or all three: hemianopia; cortical blindness; \\ndiplopia; vertigo; nystagmus; ataxia; dysarthria; dysphasia; hemi- or quadriplegia; \\nunilat eral or bilateral sensory symptoms; hiccups; coma.

Tension \\nheadaches are the most common, but beware the disabling and treatable (migraine, \\ncluster headache), and the sinister (space-occupying lesions, meningitis, subarach-\\nnoid haemorrhage). A good history is the key. Ask about:\\nOnset R\\napid onset headaches are concerning; the key diagnosis to rule out here \\nis •subarachnoid haemorrhage ( SAH, p478), sudden-onset, ‘worst ever’ headache, \\noften occipital, stiff  neck, focal signs, \\ue001consciousness. Other diff  erentials include: \\n•Meningitis (p 822): fever, photophobia, stiff   neck, purpuric rash, coma. May be \\nassociated with neck stiff ness ( ≈ meningeal irritation). Do an LP, start antibiotics. \\n•Encephalitis (p 824): fever, odd behaviour, ﬁ ts, or reduced consciousness. Do an \\nurgent CT head and LP to look for signs of infection. •Post-coital headache.\\nSubacute/gradual onset headaches:  •Venous sinus thrombosis  (p480): subacute \\nheadache, papilloedema. •Sinusitis: dull, constant ache o ver frontal or maxillary si-\\nnuses, with tenderness ± postnasal drip. Pain is worse on bending over. Ethmoid or \\nsphenoid sinus pain is felt deep in the midline at the root of the nose. Common with \\ncoryza (p\\n406). The pain lasts ~1–2 wks. CT can conﬁ  rm diagnosis but is rarely needed. \\n•Tropical illness: eg malaria: tr avel history, ﬂ  u-like illness (p416); typhus (p415). •In-\\ntr\\nacranial hypotension: CSF leakage, eg iatrogenic after LP or epidural anaesthesia. \\nSuspect if headaches worse on standing. ; treat with epidural blood patch over leak, \\nif conservative management with \\nIV ﬂ uids and caff eine fails.\\nCharacter Tight band? Think t ension headache (the usual cause of bilateral, non-\\npulsatile headache ± scalp muscle tenderness). Throbbing/pulsatile/lateralizing? \\nThink migraine (p458).\\nFrequency Headaches that recur tend to be benign: • Migr aine: p 458. • Clust er \\nheadache: (see BOX ‘Cluster headache’) • T rigeminal neuralgia: (see BOX ‘Trigemi-\\nnal neuralgia’) • R ecurrent  (Moll aret’s) meningitis: suspect if fever/meningism \\nwith each headache. Send CSF for herpes simplex PCR ( HSV2). Is there access to \\nsubarachnoid spaces via a skull fracture, or a recurring cause of aseptic meningitis \\n(\\nSLE, eg abducens nerve palsy, Behçet’s, sarcoid)?\\nDuration Chronic, progressive headaches can indicate \\ue000 ICP. Typically worse on \\nwaking, lying, bending forward, or coughing. Also: vomiting, papilloedema, sei-\\nzures, false localizing signs, or odd behaviour. Do imaging to exclude a space-\\noccupying lesion, and consider idiopathic intracranial hypertension. \\ue007\\nLP is \\ncontraindicated until after imaging.\\nAssociated features E ye pain ±  reduced vision: Think acut e glaucoma.  Typically \\nelderly, long-sighted people. Constant pain develops rapidly around one eye, radiat-\\ning to the forehead with markedly reduced vision, visual haloes, and a red, congested \\neye (p561). \\ue007Seek expert help at once. If delay in treatment of >1h is likely, give eye \\ndrops (eg 0.5% timolol maleate ± 2% pilocarpine) and acetazolamide 500mg PO. Jaw \\nclaudication t\\nender with thickened, pulseless temporal arteries: Giant cell arteritis: \\n(p556) Subacute-onset headache with ESR >40mm/h. \\ue007Exclude in all >50yrs old with a \\nheadache that has lasted a few weeks: prompt diagnosis and steroids avoid blindness.\\nPrecipitating causes Head trauma: Commonly causes localized pain but can be \\nmor\\ne generalized. It lasts ~2wks; often resistant to analgesia. Do CT to exclude \\nsubdural or extradural haemorrhage if drowsiness ± lucid interval, or focal signs \\n(p482). Also ask about:  Analgesia, sex, food (eg chocolate, cheese, coff ee).\\nRed ﬂ ags See p780.\\nDrug history E xclude medication overuse (analgesic rebound) headache: Culprits \\nar\\ne mixed analgesics (paracetamol + codeine/opiates), ergotamine, and triptans. This \\nis a common reason for episodic headache becoming chronic daily headache. Anal-\\ngesia must be withdrawn\\n—aspirin or naproxen may mollify the rebound headache. \\nA preventive may help once off   other drugs  (eg tricyclics, valproate,  gabapentin; \\np504). Limit use of over-the-counter analgesia (no more than 6d per month).\\nSocial history Ask about stress or recent life events; may not explain the pathol-\\nogy\\n, but will help you appreciate the context in which symptoms are experienced.\\n_OHCM_10e.indb   456_OHCM_10e.indb   456 02/05/2017   19:0802/05/2017   19:08'),\n",

Prophylactic treatment: Can achieve ~ 50%\\ue001 \\nin attack frequency in most patients; consider after risks and beneﬁ  ts discussion. \\n1st line: Propranolol 40–120mg/12h or topiramate 25–50mg/12h (teratogenic, can in-\\nterfere with Pill effi  cacy). Amitriptyline 10–75mg nocte can be used, though this is \\noff -licence. \\ue007Patients may be on previously-recommended prophylactic agents (eg \\nv\\nalproate, pizotifen, pregabalin or ACE-i): if achieving good control then continue \\nas required. 12-weekly botulinum toxin type A injections are a last resort in chronic \\nmigraine.   Treatment during an attack: NICE recommends an oral triptan (or nasal \\nin 12–17y) combined with either an NSAID or paracetamol.1 Monotherapy with any of \\nthe above (or aspirin 900mg) can also be considered. Anti-emetics may help even in \\nthe abscence of nausea and vomiting. Triptans are CI if IHD, coronary spasm, uncon-\\ntrolled \\ue000 BP, recent lithium, SSRIS, or ergot use. Rare SE: arrhythmias or angina ± MI, \\neven if no pre-existing risk. Non-pharmacological therapies: Warm or cold packs to \\nthe head, or r\\nebreathing into paper bag (\\ue000PaCO2) may help abort attacks. Butterbur \\nextracts or riboﬂ avin  supplementation may have a role. NICE recommend 10 sessions \\nof acupuncture over 5–8 weeks if both topiramate and propranolol are unsuitable or \\nineff ective. Transcutaneous nerve stimulation may help.\\nConsiderations in females Incidence of migraine (especially with aura) + ischae-\\nmic stroke is increased by use of a combined OCP. Use progesterone-only or non-\\nhormonal contraception in migraine + aura, though a low dose combined OCP can \\nbe used in those without aura. Further \\ue000risk: • Smoking • Age >35yrs • BP\\ue000 • Obesity \\n(body mass inde\\nx >30) • Diabetes mellitus • Hyperlipidaemia • Family history of arte-\\nriopath\\ny <45yrs. \\ue007Warn patients to stop OCP at once if they develop aura or worsen-\\ning migraine; see OHCS p301. Perimenstrual migraine: If uncontrolled with standard \\ntr\\neatment and the onset of headache is predictable then consider frovatriptan \\n2.5mg BD or zolmitriptan 2.5mg BD/TDS on the days migraine is expected. Pregnancy: \\nMigr\\naine often improves; if not, get help —worsening headaches in pregnancy are \\nassociated with a greater risk of pre-eclampsia and cardiovascular complications. \\nOff er paracetamol 1st line. Triptans and NSAIDs can be used but discuss risks and \\nbeneﬁ ts with patients ﬁ rst. Don’t use aspirin if breastfeeding. Anti-emetic: cyclizine \\nor promethazine. Prophylaxis: seek specialist advice. \\n_OHCM_10e.indb   458_OHCM_10e.indb   458 02/05/2017   19:0802/05/2017   19:08'),\n",

Onset is over seconds (not instantaneous), and is often pre-\\nceded by pre-syncopal symptoms, eg nausea, pallor, sweating, and narrowing of vis-\\nual ﬁ  elds. Brief clonic jerking of the limbs may occur due to cerebral hypoperfusion, \\nbut there is no tonic/clonic sequence. Urinary incontinence is uncommon, and there \\nis no tongue-biting. Unconsciousness usually lasts for ~\\n2min and recovery is rapid.\\nSituation syncope Symptoms as for vasovagal syncope but with a clear precipi-\\ntant: cough syncope occurs after a paroxysm of coughing; effort syncope is brought \\non b\\ny exercise; there is usually a cardiac cause, eg aortic stenosis, HCM; micturition \\ns\\nyncope happens during or after urination: mostly men, at night.\\nCarotid sinus syncope Hypersensitive baroreceptors cause excessive reﬂ e x brady-\\ncardia ± vasodilation on minimal stimulation (eg head-turning, shaving).\\nEpilepsy (p490) Features suggestive of this diagnosis include: attacks when asleep \\nor lying down; aura; identiﬁ  able triggers (eg TV); altered breathing; cyanosis; typical \\ntonic–clonic movements; incontinence of urine; tongue-biting; prolonged post-ictal \\ndrowsiness, confusion, amnesia, and transient focal paralysis (Todd’s palsy).\\nStokes–Adams attacks Transient arrhythmias (eg bradycardia due to complete \\nheart block\\n) cause \\ue001cardiac output and LOC. The patient falls to the ground (often \\nwith no warning except palpitations; injuries are common), and is pale, with a slow \\nor absent pulse. Recovery is in seconds: the patient ﬂ ushes, the pulse speeds up, and \\nconsciousness is regained. As with vasovagal syncope, anoxic clonic jerks may occur \\nin prolonged \\nLOC. Attacks may happen several times a day and in any posture.\\nOther causes Hypoglycaemia: (p214) Tremor, hunger, and perspiration herald light-\\nheadedness or LOC; rare in non-diabetics. Orthostatic hypotension: Unsteadiness or \\nLOC on standing from lying in those with inadequate vasomotor reﬂ exes: the elderly; \\nautonomic neuropathy (p505); antihypertensive medication; overdiuresis; multisys-\\ntem atrophy (MSA; p494). Anxiety: Hyperventilation, tremor, sweating, tachycardia, \\npar\\naesthesiae, light-headedness, and no LOC suggest a panic attack. Drop attacks: \\nSudden fall to the ground without LOC. Mostly benign and due to leg weakness but \\nmay also be caused by hydrocephalus, cataplexy, or narcolepsy. Factitious black-\\nouts: Pseudoseizures, Münchausen’s (p706).\\nExamination Cardiovascular, neurological. Measure BP lying and standing.\\nInvestigation All with recurrent syncope (or falls) need cardiac assessment —ur-\\ngently if associated with palpitations, arrhythmias, 3rd-degree AV block, or pro-\\nlonged QT interval (p711). ECG ± 24h ECG (arrhythmia, long QT, eg Romano–Ward, p96); \\nU&E, FBC, Mg2+, Ca2+, glucose; tilt-table test; 3 EEG, sleep EEG; echocardiogram; CT/MRI \\nbrain; ABG if practical (\\ue001PaCO2 in attacks suggests hyperventilation as the cause).\\n\\ue007While the cause is being elucidated, advise against driving (see p158).\\n3 Patient is subject to continuous ECG and BP monitoring while strapped to a table and moved rapidly from \\nresting horizontal position to vertical.

Complaints of ‘dizzy spells’ are very common and are used by \\npatients t\\no describe many diff erent sensations. True vertigo is a  hallucination of \\nmovement, often rotatory, of the patient or their surroundings. In practice, simple \\n‘spinning’ is rare—the ﬂ  oor may tilt, sink, or rise. The key to diagnosis is to ﬁ  nd out ex-\\nactly what the patient means by ‘dizzy:’ if this is not vertigo or if atypical symptoms \\nare present consider other causes, eg if there is loss of awareness, think of epilepsy \\nor syncope; if there is faintness, lightheadedness, or palpitations, think of anaemia, \\ndysrhythmia, anxiety, or hypotension.\\nAssociated symptoms:  Diffi  \\n culty walking or standing (may fall suddenly to the \\nground), relief on lying or sitting still (vertigo is almost always worsened by move-\\nment); nausea, vomiting, pallor, sweating. Associated hearing loss or tinnitus implies \\nlabyrinth or \\nVIIIth nerve involvement.\\nCauses\\nBenign positional v\\nertigo: Occurs on head movement due to disruption of debris in the \\nsemicir\\ncular canal of the ears (canalolithiasis). Fatiguable nystagmus on performing \\nthe Hallpike manoeuvre is diagnostic; Epley manoeuvres clear the debris (OHCS p555).\\nAcute labyrinthitis (vestibular neuronitis): Abrupt onset of severe vertigo, nausea, \\nv\\nomiting ± prostration. No deafness or tinnitus. Causes: virus; vascular lesion. Severe \\nvertigo subsides in days, complete recovery takes 3–4wks. \\ue057: reassure. Sedate.\\nMénière’s disease: Increased pressure in the endolymphatic system of the inner ear \\ncauses r\\necurrent attacks of vertigo lasting >20min, ﬂ uctuating (or permanent) sen-\\nsorineural hearing loss, and tinnitus (with a sense of aural fullness ± falling to one \\nside). \\ue057: bed rest and reassurance in acute attacks. An antihistamine (eg cinnarizine) \\nis useful if prolonged, or buccal prochlorperazine if severe, for up to 7d.\\nOtotoxicity: Amino glycosides, loop diuretics, or cisplatin can cause deafness ± vertigo.\\nAcoustic neuroma: ( ﬁ gs 10.12, 10.13) Doubly misnamed: it is a Schwannoma (not \\nneuroma) arising from the vestibular (not auditory) nerve. They account for 80% \\nof cerebellopontine angle tumours and often present with unilateral hearing loss, \\nwith vertigo occurring later. Growth rate is slow (usually 1–2 mm/year) and can be \\npredicted by serial MRIs. With progression, ipsilateral Vth  , VIth  , IXth  , and Xth nerves \\nmay be aff ected (also ipsilateral cerebellar signs). Signs of \\ue000 ICP occur late, indicating \\na large tumour. Commoner in \\ue033 and neuroﬁ bromatosis (esp. NF2, p514).\\nTraumatic damage: If trauma aff ects the petrous temporal bone or the cerebello-\\npontine angle then the auditory nerve may be damaged, causing vertigo, deafness, \\nand/or tinnitus.\\nHerpes zoster: Herpetic eruption of the external auditory meatus; facial palsy ± deaf-\\nness, tinnitus, and v\\nertigo (Ramsay Hunt syndrome, see p501).\\nOthers: Vertiginous epilepsy; MS; stroke/TIA; migraine; motion sickness; alcohol in-\\ntoxication.\\n_OHCM_10e.indb   462_OHCM_10e.indb   462 02/05/2017   19:0802/05/2017   19:08'),\n",

Ask your patient to repeat the number. Make sure \\nthat failure is not from misunderstanding.\\nTuning fork tests Rinne: Hold a vibrating tuning fork (512Hz or 256Hz) on the mas-\\ntoid to test bone conduction ( BC). When the sound is no longer audible move it in \\nfront of the ear with the prongs perpendicular to the auditory canal to test air con-\\nduction (\\nAC). If there is no conductive deﬁ  cit (ie in normal hearing or sensorineural \\nhearing loss), AC is better than BC and the patient will be able to hear the note again. \\nThis is a ‘Rinne positive’ result. If BC is better than AC (Rinne negative), this indicates \\nconductive deafness >20dB. A false-negative may occur in severe sensorineural hear-\\ning loss (SNHL) as the contralateral cochlea picks up the sound by bone conduction. \\nWeber: With the vibrating tuning fork on the vertex or forehead, ask the patient \\nwhich ear the sound is louder in. Sound localiz\\nes to the aff  ected ear with conductive \\nloss (>10dB loss), to the contralateral ear in SNHL, and to the midline if both ears are \\nnormal (or if bilateral SNHL).\\nConductive deafness Causes: Wax (remove, eg by syringing with warm water af-\\nt\\ner softening with olive oil drops), otosclerosis, otitis media, or glue ear (OHCS p546).\\nChronic sensorineural deafness Often due to accumulated environmental noise \\nt\\noxicity, presbyacusis, or inherited disorders. P resbyacusis: Loss of acuity for high-\\nfr\\nequency sounds starts before 30yrs old. We do not usually notice it until hearing \\nof speech is aff ected. Hearing is most aff ected in the presence of background noise. \\nHearing aids are the usual treatment.\\nSudden sensorineural deafness \\ue007Get an ENT opinion today (steroids may cure)! \\nCauses: Noise exposure; gentamicin/other toxin; mumps; acoustic neuroma; MS; \\nstroke; vasculitis; TB. Tests: ESR, FBC, LFT, pANCA, viral titres and  TB (see BOX ‘Diagnostic \\ntests for TB’, p394); evoked response audiometry; CXR; MRI; lymph node and naso-\\npharyngeal biopsy for culture.\\nTinnitus\\nThis ringing or buzzing in the ears is common, and may cause depression or insomnia. \\n\\ue007Investigate unilateral tinnitus fully to exclude an acoustic neuroma (p462).\\nCauses Inner ear damage and hearing loss (leading to auditory cortex hyper-excit-\\nabilit\\ny), wax, excess noise, head injury, otitis media, post-stapedectomy, Ménière’s, \\nanaemia (if pulsatile then think of carotid artery stenosis or dissection, AV ﬁ stulae, \\nand glomus jugulare tumours). Drugs: Aspirin (reversible), loop diur etics, aminogly-\\ncosides.

Cognitive therapy helps, as do ‘tinnitus coping training’ and pa-\\ntient support gr\\noups. Drugs are disappointing: anticonvulsants (eg carbamazepine) \\nar\\ne not of beneﬁ  t; misoprostol appears to help (small-scale trials only); hypnotics \\nat night may be of some beneﬁ t. Avoid tranquillizers, particularly if depressed (use \\ntricyclic antidep ressants here). If Ménière’s disease is the cause, betahistine helps \\nonly a few. Masking may give relief: white noise (like an off  -tuned radio) is given \\nvia a noise generator worn like a post-aural hearing aid. Hearing aids may help by \\namplifying desir\\nable sounds.

Symptoms: Bilateral leg weakness (arm weak-\\nness—often less severe—suggests a cervical cord lesion, see p508) a sensory level ± \\npreceding back pain (see p542). Bladder (and anal) sphincter involvement is late and \\nmanifests as hesitancy, frequency, and, later, as painless retention. Signs: Look for \\na mo\\ntor, reﬂ  ex, and sensory level, with normal ﬁ  ndings above the level of the lesion, \\nLMN signs at the level (especially in cervical lesions), and UMN signs below the level \\n(but remember tone and reﬂ  exes are usually reduced in acute cord compression; \\nOHCS p756). Causes: Secondary malignancy (breast, lung, prostate, thyroid, kidney) \\nin the spine is commonest. R\\narer: infection (epidural abscess), cervical disc prolapse, \\nhaematoma (warfarin), intrinsic cord tumour, atlanto –axial subluxation, myeloma. \\n\\ue031\\ue031 : Transverse myelitis, MS, carcinomatous meningitis, cord vasculitis (PAN, syphilis), \\nspinal artery thrombosis or aneurysm, trauma, Guillain–Barré syndrome (p702). In-\\nv\\nestigations: \\ue007Do not delay imaging at any cost. Spinal x-rays are unreliable; MRI is \\nthe deﬁ  nitive modality. Biopsy or surgical exploration may be needed to identify the \\nnature of any mass. Do a \\nCXR (primary lung malignancy, lung secondaries, TB). Bloods: \\nFBC, ESR, B12, syphilis serology, U&E, LFT, PSA, serum electrophoresis. Treatment: Give \\nur\\ngent dexamethasone in malignancy (p528) while considering more speciﬁ c thera-\\npy, eg radiotherapy or chemotherapy ± decompressive laminectomy; which is most \\nappropriate depends on tumour type, quality of life, and likely prognosis. Epidural \\nabscesses must be surgically decompressed and antibiotics given.\\nCauda equina and conus medullaris lesions The big diff \\nerence between these \\nlesions and those high up in the cord is that leg weakness is ﬂ  accid and areﬂ exic, \\nnot spastic and hyperreﬂ exic. Causes: As above, plus congenital lumbar disc disease \\nand lumbosacr\\nal nerve lesions. Signs: Conus medullaris lesions f eature mixed UMN/\\nLMN signs, leg weakness, early urinary retention and constipation, back pain, sacral \\nsensory disturbance and erectile dysfunction. Cauda equina lesions feature back \\npain and radicular pain down the legs; asymmetrical, atrophic, areﬂ exic paralysis of \\nthe legs; sensory loss in a root distribution; and \\ue001sphincter tone; do PR.\\nOther patterns of leg weakness\\nUnilat\\neral foot drop: DM, common peroneal nerve palsy, stroke, prolapsed disc, MS.\\nWeak legs with no sensory loss: MND, polio , para sagittal meningioma (an exception \\nto the rule that weak legs mean cord or distal lesion).\\nChronic spastic paraparesis:  MS, cord primary malignancy/metastasis, MND, syrin-\\ngomyelia, subacute combined degeneration of the cord (p 334), hereditary spastic \\nparaparesis, taboparesis (tertiary syphilis, see p 412), histiocytosis X, parasites (eg \\nschistosomiasis).\\nChronic ﬂ accid paraparesis: Peripheral neur o path y, myopathy.\\nAbsent knee jerks and extensor plantars: (Ie combined LMN or UMN signs.)

Cause: parkinsonism (p 494).\\n  • Int ention tremor: Irregular, large-amplitude, worse at the end of purposeful acts, eg \\nﬁ \\nnger-pointing or using a remote control. Cause: cerebellar damage (eg MS, stroke).\\n  • P ostural tremor: Absent at rest, present on maintained posture (arms out str etched) \\nand may persist (but is not worse) on movement. Causes: benign essential tremor \\n(autosomal dominant; improves with alcohol), thyrotoxicosis, anxiety, \\ue020-agonists.\\n  • R e-emergent tremor: Postural tremor developing after a delay of ~10s. Causes: \\nParkinson’s disease (don’t mistake for essential tremor).\\nChorea Non-rhythmic, jerky, purposeless movements ﬂ  itting from one place to \\nanother—eg facial grimacing, raising the shoulders, ﬂ  exing/extending the ﬁ ngers. \\nCauses: Huntington’s disease, Syden ham’ s chorea (rare complication of group A \\nstreptococcal infection). Worsened by levodopa.\\nHemiballismus Large-amplitude, ﬂ inging hemichorea (aff  ects proximal muscles) \\ncontralateral to a vascular lesion of the subthalamic nucleus (often elderly diabet-\\nics). Recovers spontaneously over months.\\nAthetosis Slow, sinuous, conﬂ  uent, purposeless movements (especially digits, \\nhands, face, tongue), often diffi  cult to distinguish from chorea. Causes: Common-\\nest is cer\\nebral palsy (OHCS p214). Most other ‘athetoid’ patterns may now be better \\nclassed as dystonias. Pseudoathetosis: Caused by severe proprioceptive loss.\\nTics Brief, repeated, stereotyped movements which patients may suppress for a \\nwhile. T\\nics are common in children (and usually resolve). In Tourette’s s yndrome \\n(p700), motor and vocal tics occur. Consider psychological support, clonazepam or \\nclonidine if tics are severe (haloperidol may help but risks tardive dyskinesia).\\nMyoclonus Sudden involuntary focal or general jerks arising from cord, brainstem, \\nor cer\\nebral cortex, seen in metabolic problems, neurodegenerative disease (eg lysoso-\\nmal storage enzyme defects), CJD (p696), and myoclonic epilepsies (infantile spasms). \\nBenign essential myoclonus: Childhood onset with frequent generalized myoclonus, \\nwithout pr\\nogression. Often autosomal dominant. It may respond to valproate, \\nclonazepam, or piracetam. Asterixis (‘metabolic ﬂ ap ’): Jerking (~ 1–2 jerks/sec) of \\noutstretched hands, worse with wrists extended, from loss of extensor tone—ie inco-\\nordination between ﬂ exors and extensors (=‘negative myoclonus’).

If the \\naffl  icted touched a relic of St Vitus they were miraculously cured: observing this, \\nParacelsus, 16th-century Swiss-German physician and philosopher, described the \\nphenomenon of chorea Sancti Viti (‘St Vitus’s dance’). There may have been an in-\\nfectious component, although mass hysteria induced by religious cults that swept \\nacross medieval Europe seems a more likely cause. Chorea was subsequently \\nused as a general term for large-amplitude involuntary movements before be-\\ning further reﬁ  ned by physicians such as Sydenham (though he did not connect \\nhis eponymous chorea seen in rheumatic fever with an infectious trigger) and \\nCharcot. Nowaways, a more frequent cause of involuntary movements with be-\\nhavioural disturbance is NMDA-receptor antibody encephalitis, the impact of which \\nwas documented in Susannah Cahalan’s excellent 2012 autobiography Brain on \\nFire: My Month of Madness .\\nSt Vitus’s dance \\nDystonia describes prolonged muscle contractions causing abnormal posture or \\nrepetitive movements.\\nIdiopathic generalized dystonia:  Childhood-onset dystonia often starting in one \\nleg with ipsilateral progression over 5–10yrs. Autosomal dominant inheritance is \\ncommon (DYT1 deletion). Exclude Wilson’s disease and dopa-responsive dystonia \\n(needs an L-dopa trial). Anticholinergics and muscle relaxants  may help. Deep \\nbrain stimulation for refractory, disabling symptoms.\\nFocal dystonias: Conﬁ  ned to one part of the body, eg spasmodic torticollis  (head \\npulled to one side), blepharospasm  (involuntary contraction of orbicularis oculi, \\nOHCS p417), writer’s cramp. Focal dystonias in adults are typically idiopathic, and \\nrarely generalize. They are worsened by stress. Patients may develop a geste an-\\ntagoniste to try to resist the dystonic posturing (eg a touch of the ﬁ nger to the jaw \\nin spasmodic torticollis). Injection of botulinum toxin into the overactive muscles \\nis usually eff ective.\\nAcute dystonia:  (ﬁ g 10.14) May occur on starting many drugs, including neuro-\\nleptics and some anti-emetics (eg metoclopramide, cyclizine).

If no primary haemorrhage \\non CT, give 2 weeks of aspirin 300mg, then switch to long-term clopidogrel monother-\\napy. If this is CI or not tolerated then give low dose aspirin plus slow-release dipyrida-\\nmole. Anticoagulation after stroke from AF: See BOX ‘Cardiac causes of stroke’.\\nTests (See p470 for imaging.) Investigate promptly to identify risk factors for fur-\\nther strokes, but consider whether results will aff ect management. Look for:\\n  • Hyper tension. Look for retinopathy (p560), nephropathy, or cardiomegaly on CXR.\\n  • Car diac source of emboli. (See BOX ‘Cardiac causes of stroke’.) 24h ECG to look \\nfor AF (p130). CXR may show an enlarged left atrium. Echocardiogram may reveal \\nmural thrombus due to AF or a hypokinetic segment of cardiac muscle post- MI. \\nIt may also show valvular lesions in infective endocarditis or rheumatic heart \\ndisease.

Rehabilitation must be started early post-stroke in order \\nto maximize improvement and prevent complications related to immobility such as \\npressure sores, aspiration pneumonia, constipation, and contractures. Ongoing input \\nafter discharge consolidates inpatient gains and helps align the individual with their \\nprevious capability. It also helps with depression\\n—both in the patient and their carer. \\n\\ue007Setting achievable goals and acknowledging the patient’s own agenda is key.\\nImperatives for re-enablement\\n  • Watch the patient swallow a small volume of water; if signs of aspiration (a cough \\nor v\\noice change) make nil by mouth until formal assessment by a speech therapist. \\nUse IV ﬂ uids, then semi-solids (eg jelly; avoid soups and crumbly food). Avoid early \\nNG tube feeds; these may be needed to safeguard nutrition in those with swallowing \\nproblems that persist beyond the ﬁ rst 2–3d. If swallowing fails to recover, consider \\nbeneﬁ ts of enteral feeding tube placement (p759). Speech therapists skilled in assess-\\ning swallowing diffi   culties are invaluable here.\\n  • Avoid further injury: minimize falls risk and take care when lifting the patient not \\nt\\no damage their shoulders.\\n  • Ensure good bladder and bowel care through frequent toileting. Avoid early cath-\\net\\nerization which may prevent return to continence.\\n  • Position to minimize spasticity (occurs in ~40%). Get prompt physiotherapy. Splints \\nand botulinum toxin injections are helpful for focal spasticity.\\n  • Monitor progress: eg measure time taken to sit up and transfer to chair.\\n  • Monitor mood: in pseudo-emotionalism/emotional lability (sobbing unprovoked \\nb\\ny sorrow, from failure of cortical inhibition of the limbic system), tricyclics or \\nﬂ uoxetine may help.\\n  • Engage the patient in their own recovery by making physiotherapy fun.

Features are dependent on the sinus aff ected:\\n  • Sagitt\\nal sinus: Head ache, v omiting, seizures, \\ue001vision, papilloedema.\\n  • T ransverse sinus: Headache ± mast oid pain, focal CNS signs, seizures, papilloedema.\\n  • Sigmoid sinus: Cerebellar signs, lower cranial nerve palsies.\\n  • Inf erior petrosal sinus: Vth and VIth cranial nerve palsies, with temporal and \\nretro-orbital pain (Gradenigo’s syndrome. , suggesting otitis media is the cause).\\n  • Cav ernous sinus: Often due to spread from facial pustules or fol liculitis, causing  \\nheadache, chemosis, oedematous eyelids, proptosis, painful ophthalmoplegia, fever.\\nCortical vein thrombosis (CVT) Usually occurs with a sinus thrombus as it extends \\nint\\no the cortical veins, causing infarction in a venous territory (ﬁ g 10.21). These infarcts \\ngive rise to stroke-like focal symptoms that develop over days. There are often seizures, \\nand an associated headache which may come on suddenly (thunderclap headache).\\nCauses Numerous, including anything that promotes a hypercoagulable state (p\\n374). \\nCommon causes: Pregnancy/puerperium, combined OCP, head injury, dehydration, \\nblood dyscrasias, tumours (local invasion/pressure), extracranial malignancy (hyperco-\\nagulability), recent \\nLP. Other causes: Infection (meningitis, abscesses, otitis media, cer-\\nebr\\nal malaria, TB), Drugs (eg antiﬁ brinolytics, androgens), SLE, vasculitis, Crohn’s or UC.\\nDiff erential diagnosis Subarachnoid haemorrhage, meningitis, encephalitis, in-\\ntr\\nacranial abscess, arterial infarction.\\nInvestigations Exclude subarachnoid haemorrhage (if thunderclap headache, \\np478) and meningitis (p822). Bloods: Thrombophilia screen. Imaging: CT/MRI venog-\\nraphy may show the absence of a sinus (ﬁ g 10.19), though an absent transverse sinus \\ncan be a normal variant. MRI T2-weighted gradient echo sequences can visualize \\nthrombus directly (ﬁ g 10.20), and also identify haemorrhagic infarction. CT may be \\nnormal early, but show a ﬁ lling defect at ~1wk (delta sign). LP (if no CI): raised open-\\ning pressure. CSF may be normal, or show RBCS and xanthochromia.\\nManagement Seek expert help. Anticoagulation with heparin or LMWH and then \\nwarfarin (INR 2–3) may beneﬁ  t even if there is secondary cerebral haemorrhage (un-\\nless otherwise CI). If there is deterioration despite adequate anticoagulation, endo-\\nvascular thrombolysis or mechanical thrombectomy may provide limited beneﬁ t (but \\nnot in those with large infarcts and impending herniation). \\ue000ICP requires prompt at-\\ntention (p830); decompressive hemicraniectomy may prevent impending herniation.\\n9 Predictors of poor prognosis include: GCS score on admission <9, deep CVT location, CNS infection, malig-\\nnancy, intracranial haemorrhage, mental status abnormality, age >37 years, and \\ue032.\\n_OHCM_10e.indb   480_OHCM_10e.indb   480 02/05/2017   19:0802/05/2017   19:08'),\n",

Bleeding \\nis from bridging veins between cortex and venous sinuses (vulnerable to decelera-\\ntion injury), resulting in accumulating haematoma between dura and arachnoid. This \\ngradually raises \\nICP, shifting midline structures away from the side of the clot and, if \\nuntreated, eventual tentorial herniation and coning. Most subdurals are from trauma \\nbut the trauma is often forgotten as it was so minor or so long ago (up to \\n9 months).\\nIt can also occur without trauma (eg \\ue001ICP; dural metast ases). The elderly are most \\nsusceptible, as brain atrophy makes bridging veins vulnerable. Other risk factors:  \\nfalls (epileptics, alcoholics); anticoagulation.\\nSymptoms Fluctuating level of consciousness (seen in 35%) ± insidious physical \\nor intellectual slowing, sleepiness, headache, personality change, and unsteadiness.\\nSigns \\ue000ICP (p830), seizures. Localizing neurological symptoms (eg unequal pupils, \\nhemiparesis) occur late, often >1 month after the injury.\\nDiff er entials Stroke, dementia, CNS masses (eg tumours, abscesses).\\nImaging (ﬁ g 10.22) CT/MRI shows clot ± midline shift (but beware bilateral isodense \\nclots). Look for crescent-shaped collection of blood over 1 hemisphere. The sickle-\\nshape diff erent iates subdural blood from extradural haemorrhage.\\nManagement Reverse clotting abnormalities urgently. Surgical management de-\\npends on the siz\\ne of the clot, its chronicity, and the clinical picture: generally those \\n>10mm or with midline shift >5mm need evacuating (via craniotomy or burr hole \\nwashout). Address the cause of the trauma (eg falls, abuse).\\nExtradural (epidural) haematoma\\n\\ue007 Beware deteriorating consciousness after any head injury that initially produced \\nno loss o\\nf consciousness or after initial drowsiness post injury seems to have re-\\nsolved. This lucid interval pattern is typical of extradural bleeds.\\nCause \\ue007Suspect after any traumatic skull fracure. Often due to a fractured temporal \\nor parietal bone causing lacer\\nation of the middle meningeal artery and vein, typically \\nafter trauma to a temple just lateral to the eye. Any tear in a dural venous sinus will \\nalso result in an extradural bleed. Blood accumulates between bone and dura.\\nClinical features The lucid interval may last a few hours to a few days before a \\nbleed declar\\nes itself by \\ue001 GCS from rising ICP. Increasingly severe headache, vomit-\\ning, confusion, and seizures follow, ± hemiparesis with brisk reﬂ  exes and an up-\\ngoing plantar. If bleeding contin ues, the ipsilateral pupil dilates, coma deepens, \\nbilateral limb weakness develops, and breathing becomes deep and irregular \\n(brainstem compression). Death follows a period of coma and is due to respiratory \\narrest. Bradycardia and \\ue000\\nBP are late signs.\\nDiff er entials Epilepsy, carotid dissection, carbon monoxide poisoning.\\nTests CT (ﬁ g 10.23) shows a haematoma (often biconvex/lens-shaped; the blood \\nforms a more rounded shape compared with the sickle-shaped subdural haemato-\\nma as the tough dural attachments to the skull keep it more localized).

The initial presentation is usually of memory loss over months or years (\\ue007look \\nf\\nor other causes if over days/weeks). Prevalence increases with age: 20% of people \\n>80yrs are known to have dementia, yet probably only half of cases are diagnosed.\\nDiagnosis Is made by: History from the patient with a thorough collateral nar-\\nr\\native—ask about the timeline of decline and the domains aff  ected. Non-cognitive \\nsymptoms such as agitation, aggression, or apathy indicate late disease.5 Cognitive \\nt\\nesting: Use a validated dementia screen such as the AMTS (p64) or similar, plus short \\ntests of executive function and language. Carry out a mental state examination to \\nidentify anxiety, depression, or hallucinations. Examination may identify a physical \\ncause, risk f\\nactors (eg for vascular dementia), or parkinsonism. Medication review \\nis important t\\no exclude drug-induced cognitive impairment.\\nInvestigations Look for reversible/organic causes: \\ue000 TSH/\\ue001B12/\\ue001folate (treat low-\\nnormals, p334), \\ue001thiamine (eg alcohol), \\ue001Ca 2+. Check MSU, FBC, ESR, U&E, LFT, and glu-\\ncose. An MRI (preferred to CT) can identify other reversible pathologies (eg subdural \\nhaematoma, p482; normal-pressure hydrocephalus11), as well as underlying vascular \\ndamage or structural pathology. Functional imaging (FDG, PET, SPECT) may help de-\\nlineate subtypes where diagnosis is not clear. Consider EEG in: suspected delirium, \\nfrontotemporal dementia, CJD, or a seizure disorder. If clinically indicated then check \\nautoantibodies, syphilis, HIV, CJD, or other rare causes (see later in topic).\\nSubtypes • Alzheimer ’s disease (AD): See p488. • Vascular dementia:  (~25%.) Cu-\\nmulative eff ect of many small strokes: sudden onset and stepwise deterioration is \\ncharacteristic (but often hard to recognize). Look for evidence of arteriopathy (\\ue000BP, \\npast strokes, focal CNS signs). \\ue007Do not use acetylcholinesterase inhibitors or me-\\nmantine in these patients. • Lewy body dementia: ( 15–25%.) Fluctuating cognitive \\nimpairment, det ailed visual hallucinations, and later, parkinsonism (p 494). Histol-\\nogy is characterized by Lewy bodies (eosinophilic intracytoplasmic inclusion bodies) \\nin brainstem and neocortex. \\ue007Avoid using antipsychotics in Lewy body dementia \\n(\\ue000\\ue000risk o\\nf SE, see p489). • Fronto-temporal dementia: Frontal and temporal atrophy \\nwith loss of >70% of spindle neurons. Patients display executive impairment; be-\\nhavioural/personality change; disinhibition; hyperorality, stereotyped behaviour, and \\nemotional unconcern. Episodic memory and spatial orientation are preserved until \\nlater stages. Pick’s disease refers to the few fronto-temporal dementia patients who \\nhave Pick inclusion bodies on histology (spherical clusters of tau-laden neurons).\\nOther causes Alcohol/drug abuse; repeated head trauma; pellagra (p\\n268), Whip-\\nple’s disease (p716); Huntington’s (p702); CJD (p696); Parkinson’s (p494); HIV; crypto-\\ncoccosis (p408); familial autosomal dominant Alzheimer’s; CADASIL (p470).\\nManagement \\ue007Refer suspected or diagnosed dementia to integrated memory ser-\\nvices f\\nor further assessment and management. Medication: (p489). Avoid drugs that \\nimpair cognition (eg neur\\noleptics, sedatives, tricyclics). Non-pharmacological inter-\\nv\\nentions: Non-cognitive symptoms (eg agitation) may respond to measures such as \\nar\\nomatherapy, multisensory stimulation, massage, music, and animal-assisted therapy.\\nOther considerations • Depr ession: Common. Try an SSRI (eg citalopram 10–20mg \\nOD) or, if severe, mirtazapine ( 15–45mg at night if eGFR >40). Cognitive behavioural \\ntherapy can help with social withdrawal and catastrophic thinking. • Capacit y: Can \\nthe patient mak\\ne decisions regarding medical or ﬁ nancial aff airs?

Suspect \\nAD in adults >40yrs with per-\\nsistent,12 progressive, and global cognitive impairment: visuo-spatial skill, memory, \\nverbal abilities, and executive function (planning) are all aff  ected, unlike other de-\\nmentias which may aff  ect certain domains but not others (identify which with neu-\\nropsychometric tests). There is also anosognosia\\n—a lack of insight into the problems \\nengendered by the disease, eg missed appointments, misunderstood conversations \\nor plots of ﬁ lms, and mishandling of money. Later there may be irritability; mood dis-\\nturbance (depression or euphoria); behavioural change (eg aggression, wandering, \\ndisinhibition); psychosis (hallucinations or delusions); agnosia (may not recognize \\nself in the mirror). There is no standard natural history. Cognitive impairment is \\nprogressive, but non-cognitive symptoms may come and go over months. Eventually \\nmany patients become sedentary, taking little interest in anything.\\nCause Environmental and genetic factors both play a role. Accumulation of \\n\\ue020-am\\nyloid peptide, a degradation product of amyloid precursor protein, results in \\nprogressive neuronal damage, neuroﬁ b rillary tangles, \\ue000numbers of amyloid plaques, \\nand loss of the neurotransmitter acetylcholine (ﬁ g 10.24). Neuronal loss is selective—\\nthe hippocampus, amygdala, temporal neocortex, and subcortical nuclei are most \\nvulnerable.\\n Vascular eff  ects are also important—95% of AD patients show evidence \\nof vascular dementia.\\nRisk factors 1st-degree relative with AD; Down’s syndrome (in which AD is in-\\nevitable, often <40yrs); homozygosity for apolipoprotein E (ApoE) E4 allele (see BOX \\n‘Genetics and the future’); PICALM, CL1 & CLU variants; vascular risk factors (\\ue000BP, dia-\\nbetes, dyslipidaemia, \\ue000homocysteine, AF); \\ue001physical/cognitive activity; depression; \\nloneliness (\\ue000risk ≈ 2; simply living alone is not a risk factor); smoking.\\nManagement \\ue007See p 486 for a general approach to management in dementia. \\n• Refer to a specialist memory service. • Acetylcholinesterase inhibitors (see BOX  \\n‘Pharmacological treatment’). • BP control (in heart failure there is a 2x \\ue000risk of AD; \\nextra risk halves with BP control).\\nPrevention in the context of AD’s time-course: Changes in CSF \\ue020-amyloid are seen \\n~25yrs before onset of unequivocal symptoms ( USy) and its deposition is detected \\n15yrs before USy. CSF tau protein and brain atrophy are also detected 15yrs before \\nUSy. Cerebral hypometabolism and impaired episodic memory occur 10yrs before \\nUSy. Global cognitive impairment occurs 5yrs before USy. Prevention will probably \\nbe most eff ective before any of this starts —though there is currently insuffi  cient \\nevidence to recommend any speciﬁ c interventions (BOX ‘Genetics and the future’).  \\nUltimately, there is no simple relationship between brain structure, neuroﬁ brillary \\ntangles, and function.\\nPrognosis Mean survival = 7yrs from USy.\\n12 ‘Enduring’ doesn’t mean unﬂ uctuating: cognition comes and goes, allowing poetic insights, as in Iris \\nMurdoch’s poignant self-diagnosis: ‘I am sailing into the dark’.\\n_OHCM_10e.indb   488_OHCM_10e.indb   488 02/05/2017   19:0802/05/2017   19:08'),\n",

Convulsions are the motor signs \\nof elect rical discharges.\\nElements of a seizure Some patients may experience a preceding pr odrome last-\\ning hours or days in which there may be a change in mood or behaviour. An aura \\nimplies a focal seizure, often, but not necessarily, from the temporal lobe. It may be a \\nstrange feeling in the gut, an experience such as déjà vu or strange smells or ﬂ ashing \\nlights. Post-ictally there may be headache, confusion, and myalgia; or temporary \\nweakness after a focal seizure in the motor cortex (Todd’s palsy, p712), or dysphasia \\nfollowing a focal seizure in the temporal lobe.\\nCauses ⅔ ar e idiopathic. Structural:  Cortical scarring (eg head injury years be-\\nf\\nore onset), developmental (eg dysembryoplastic neuroepithelial tumour or corti-\\ncal dysgenesis), space-occupying lesion, stroke, hippocampal sclerosis (eg after a \\nfebrile convulsion), vascular malformations. Others: Tuberous sclerosis, sarcoido-\\nsis,\\n SLE, PAN, antibodies to voltage-gated potassium channels.\\nDiagnosis Can be diffi  cult due to the heterogenous nature of the disease (there are \\n>40 diff  erent types of epilepsy). NICE estimate 5–30% of people with ‘epilepsy’ have \\nbeen wrongly diagnosed. \\ue007 All patients with a seizure must be referred for specialist \\nassessment and in\\nvestigation in <2 wks.\\nTake a thorough history: Including a detailed description from a witness. Ask spe-\\nciﬁ \\ncally about tongue-biting and a slow recovery. If this is a ﬁ  rst seizure, enquire \\nabout past funny turns/odd behaviour. Déjà vu and odd episodic feelings of fear \\nmay well be relevant. Are there any triggers (eg alcohol, stress, ﬂ ickering lights/\\nTV)? \\nTriggered attacks tend to recur.\\nEstablish the type of seizure: See BOX ‘Seizure classiﬁ cation’.7 NB: if a seizure be-\\ngins with focal features, it is a partial seizure, however r apidly it then generalizes. \\n\\ue007Don’t forget non-epileptic attack disorder ( = ‘pseudo’ seizures—psychogenic): this \\nis not uncommon. (Suspect if seizures have a gradual onset, prolonged duration, and \\nabrupt termination and are accompanied by closed eyes ± resistance to eye opening, \\nrapid breathing, ﬂ uctuating motor activity, and episodes of motionless unrespon-\\nsiveness. \\nCNS exam, CT, MRI, and EEG are normal. It may coexist with true epilepsy.)\\nRule out provoking causes: Most people would have a seizure given suffi  cient prov-\\nocation (eg reﬂ ex anoxic seizures in faints) but would not be classed as epileptic: only \\n3–10% of provoked seizures recur; generally when the provocation is irreversible. \\nCauses: trauma; stroke; haemorrhage; \\ue000ICP; alcohol or benzodiazepine withdrawal; \\nmetabolic disturbance (hypoxia, \\ue000\\ue001Na + , \\ue001Ca2+, \\ue000\\ue001glucose, uraemia, liver disease); in-\\nfection (eg meningitis, encephalitis); \\ue000 T°; drugs (tricyclics, cocaine). \\ue007Unprovoked \\nseizur\\nes have a recur rence rate of 30–50%.\\nInvestigations Look for provoking causes. Consider an EEG: it cannot exclude epi-\\nlepsy and can be falsely +ve, so don’t do one if simple syncope is the likely diagno-\\nsis. Only do emergency EEGS if non-convulsive status is the problem. Other tests:  \\nMRI (structural lesions); drug levels (if on anti-epileptics: is the patient compli-\\nant?); drugs screen; LP (eg if infection suspected).\\nCounselling After any ‘ﬁ  t’, advise about dangers, eg swimming, driving, heights  \\nuntil the diagnosis is known;  then give individualized counselling on employment, \\nsport, insurance, and conception ( OHCS p 28).

AED choice depends on \\nseizure type and epilepsy syndrome, comorbidities, lifestyle, and patient preference:\\n  • F ocal (partial) seizures: 1st line: carbamazepine or lamotrigine. 2nd line: leveti-\\nracetam, oxcarbazepine, or sodium valproate.13\\n  • Generalized tonic-clonic seizures: 1st line: sodium valproate13 or lamotrigine. 2nd \\nline: carbamazepine, clobazam, levetiracetam, or topiramate.\\n  • Absence seizur es: 1st line: sodium valproate13 or ethosuximide. 2nd line: lamotrigine.\\n  • My oclonic seizures: 1st line: sodium valproate.13 2nd line: levetiracetam, or topira-\\nmate (but \\ue000SE). Avoid carbamazepine and oxcarbazepine—may worsen seizures.\\n  • T onic or atonic seizures: Sodium valproate 13 or lamotrigine.\\nTreat with one drug and with one doctor in charge only. Slowly build up doses over \\n2–3 months (see BOX ‘Anti-epileptic drugs ( AEDS)’) until seizures are controlled or \\nmaximum dosage is reached. If ineff ective or not tolerated, switch to the next most \\nappropriate drug. To switch drugs, introduce the new drug slowly, and only with-\\ndraw the 1st drug once established on the 2nd. Dual (adjunct) therapy is necessary \\nin <10% of patients—consider if all appropriate drugs have been tried singly at the \\noptimum dose.\\nStopping AEDS: May be done under specialist supervision if the patient has been \\nseizur\\ne-free for >2yrs and after assessing risks and beneﬁ ts for the individual (eg \\nthe need to drive). The dose must be decreased slowly: over at least 2–3 months, or \\n>6 months for benzodiazepines and barbiturates.\\nOther interventions Ps ychological therapies:  Eg relaxation, CBT. May beneﬁ t \\nsome, but do not improve seizure frequency so only use as an adjunct to medica-\\ntion. Surgical intervention: Can be considered if a single epileptogenic focus can \\nbe identiﬁ  \\ned (such as hippocampal sclerosis or a small low-grade tumour). Neuro-\\nsurgical resection off  ers up to 70% chance of seizure resolution, but carries the risk \\nof causing focal neurological deﬁ cits. Alternatives: vagal nerve stimulation, deep \\nbrain stimulation (DBS).\\nSudden unexpected death in epilepsy ( SUDEP) More common in uncontrolled \\nepileps\\ny, and may be related to nocturnal seizure-associated apnoea or asystole.\\nThose with epilepsy have 3x \\ue000mortality. >700 epilepsy-related deaths are recorded/\\nyr in the UK; up to 17% are SUDEPs.

Expressionless face.\\nCauses\\nP\\narkinson’s disease ( PD): Loss of dopaminergic neurons \\nin the substantia nigr\\na, associated with Lewy bodies in the basal ganglia, brain-\\nstem, and cortex. Most cases are sporadic, though multiple genetic loci have been \\nidentiﬁ ed in familial cases. Mean age at onset is \\n60yrs. Prevalence: \\ue000 with age: 3.5% \\nat 85–89yrs. Clinical features: The parkinsonian triad, plus non-motor symptoms \\nsuch as: aut\\nonomic dysfunction (postural hypotension, constipation, urinary fre-\\nquency/urgency, dribbling of saliva), sleep disturbance, and reduced sense of smell. \\nNeuropsychiatric complications, such as depression, dementia, and psychosis, are \\ncommon and debilitating. Diagnosis: Is clinical and based on the core features of \\nbr\\nadykinesia with resting tremor and/or hypertonia; cerebellar disease and fronto-\\ntemporal dementia should be excluded; a clinical response to dopaminergic therapy \\nis supportive. \\ue007Signs are invariably worse on one side\\n—if symmetrical look for other \\ncauses. If an alternative cause is suspected then consider MRI to rule out structural \\npathology. Functional neuroimaging (DaTscan™, PET) is playing an emerging role. \\nTreatment: Focuses on symptom control and does not slow disease progression \\n(see BOX). Non-pharmacological options include deep brain stimulation (DBS, may help \\nthose who are partly dopamine-responsive) and surgical ablation of overactive basal \\nganglia circuits\\n (eg subthalamic nuclei).\\nParkinson’s plus syndromes Pr o gressive supranuclear palsy: ( PSP, Steele–Rich-\\nardson–Olszewski syndrome.) E arly postural instability, vertical gaze palsy ± falls; \\nrigidity of trunk  >limbs; symmetrical onset; speech and swallowing problems; little \\ntremor. Multiple system atrophy:  (MSA; Shy–Drager.) Early autonomic features,  eg \\nimpotence/incontinence, postural \\ue001BP; cerebellar + pyr amidal signs; rigidity > tremor. \\nCortico-basal degeneration: ( CBD.) Akinetic rigidity involving one limb; cortical \\nsensory loss (eg astereognosis); apraxia (even autonomous interf ering activity by \\naff ected limb—the ‘alien limb’ phenomenon). Lewy body dementia: See p486.\\nSecondary causes V ascular parkinsonism: ( 2.5–5% of parkinsonism, also called \\n‘lower limb’ parkinsonism). Eg diabetic/hypertensive pa tient with postural instabil-\\nity and falls (rather than tremor, bradykinesia, and festination). Other secondary \\ncauses: Drugs (neuroleptics, metoclopramide, prochlor pera zine), toxins (manganese), \\nWilson’s disease (p285), trauma (dementia pugilistica), encephalitis, neurosyphilis.\\nManagement Requires input of a a multidis ciplinary t eam (GP, neurologist, nurse \\nspecialist, social worker, carers, physio- and occupational therapist) to boost quality \\nof life. Assess disability and cognition objectively and reg ularly , and monitor mood—\\ndepression is common. Involve palliative care services early on. Postural exercises \\nand weight lifting may help. \\ue007Don’t forget the carers (p\\n487): off  er respite care. \\nFig 10.25 ‘Marche à petit pas.’\\n_OHCM_10e.indb   494_OHCM_10e.indb   494 02/05/2017   19:0802/05/2017   19:08'),\n",

Effi   cacy of this therapy reduces with time, requiring larger and \\nmore frequent dosing, with worsening \\nSEs and response ﬂ  uctuations (such as \\nunpredictable freezing and pronounced end-of-dose reduced response: ~50% at \\n6yrs). Starting late may therefore be wise, eg when >70yrs or when PD seriously \\ninterferes with life: discuss pros and cons with the patient. \\ue007Do not withdraw \\nmedication suddenly—risks acute akinesia and neuroleptic malignant syndrome. Be \\naware of situations where malabsorption could also have this eff  ect (eg abdominal \\nsurgery, gastroenteritis).\\nLevodopa: Dopamine precursor, given combined with a dopa-decarboxylase inhibi-\\nt\\nor in co-beneldopa or co-careldopa. SES: dyskinesia, painful dystonia. Non-motor \\nSES: psychosis; visual hallucinations, nausea and vomiting (give domperidone). \\nModiﬁ ed-release preparations should only be used in late disease.\\nDopamine agonists  (DAS): Ropinirole and pramipexole  monotherapy can delay \\nstarting levodopa in early stages of PD, and allow lower doses of levodopa as PD \\nprogresses. Rotigotine transdermal patches are available as mono- or additive. \\nSES: drowsiness, nausea, hallucinations, compulsive behaviour (gambling, hyper-\\nsexuality, p449). Ergot-derived DA-agonists ( bromocriptine, pergolide, cabergo-\\nline) can cause ﬁ  brotic reactions, and are not favoured.  Amantadine (weak DA) is \\nused for drug-induced dyskinesias in late PD.\\nApomorphine: Potent DA agonist used with continuous SC infusion to even out end-\\nof-dose eff  ects, or as a rescue-pen for sudden ‘off ’ freezing. SE: injection-site ulcers.\\nAnticholinergics: (Eg benzhexol, orphenadrine.) Cause confusion in the elderly \\nand ha\\nve multiple SES—limit to younger patients (but not 1st line).\\nMAO-B inhibitors: (Eg rasagiline, selegiline.) An alternative to dopamine agonists \\nin early PD. SEs include postural hypotension and atrial ﬁ brillation.\\nCOMT inhibitors: (Eg entacapone, tolcapone.) May help motor complications in \\nlat\\ne disease. Lessen the ‘off ’ time in those with end-of-dose wearing off .

Demyelination heals \\npoorly, eventually causing axonal loss;  >80% of patients develop progressive disabil-\\nity. The exact cause of the disease remains unknown; it is most likely a combination \\nof genetic and environmental factors. There is >30% concordance in identical twins, \\nand unusual geographical distribution, with increasing incidence with latitude in \\nsome parts of the world (\\nNB: adult migrants take their risk with them; children ac-\\nquire the risk of where they settle)—leading to hypotheses of the roles of vitamin D \\nand infection. Mean age of onset is 30yrs. \\ue033:\\ue032 ≥3:1.\\nPresentation Usually monosymptomatic: ~20% present with unilateral optic neuri-\\ntis (pain on eye movement and \\ue001rapid central vision). Corticospinal tract and bladder \\ninvolvement are also common, and symptoms may worsen with heat (eg hot bath or \\nexercise). Other symptoms/signs see table \\n10.8.\\nDiagnosis This is clinical, made by a consultant neurologist using established crite-\\nria (eg McDonald, see table 10.9) and after alternative diagnoses have been excluded. \\n\\ue007Early diagnosis and treatment reduce relapse rates and disability so refer to neu-\\nr\\nology as soon as MS is suspected.\\nTests Depending on presenting symptoms, some patients may need extra support-\\ning inf\\normation to make a diagnosis (as per the McDonald criteria). MRI: Sensi-\\ntive but not sp e ciﬁ c for plaque detection. It may also exclude other causes, eg cord \\ncompression. CSF: Oligoclonal bands of IgG on electrophoresis that are not present \\nin serum suggest CNS inﬂ am mation. Delayed visual, auditory, and somatosensory \\nevoked potentials.\\nP\\nrogression Most patients follow a relapsing-remitting course, with initial recov-\\nery in bet\\nween relapses. With time, remission becomes incomplete, so disability \\naccumulates (secondary progression). 10% of patients display steadily progressive \\ndisability in the absence of relapses (primary progressive MS), while a minority of pa-\\ntients experience no progressive disablement at all. Poor prognostic signs: Older \\ue032; \\nmo\\ntor signs at onset; many early relapses; many MRI lesions; axonal loss. Pregnancy: \\nDoes no\\nt alter the rate of progression: relapses may reduce during pregnancy and \\nincrease 3–6 months afterwards, but return to their previous rate thereafter.\\nManagement As with all neurological conditions, requires the coordinated care of a \\nmultidis ciplinary t\\neam and full involvement of the patient in all decisions.8\\nLifestyle advice: Regular exercise, stopping smoking and avoiding stress may help.\\nDisease-modifying drugs: Dimethyl fumarate is an option for mild/moderate re-\\nlapsing-r\\nemitting MS. The monoclonal antibodies alemtuzumab (acts against T cells) \\nand natalizumab (acts against VLA-4 receptors that allow immune cells to cross the \\nblood–brain barrier) are also approved for relapsing-remitting disease. Interferon \\nbeta and glatiramer are not recommended by NICE on the balance of clinical and \\ncost-eff ectiveness. Azathioprine is not recommended due to its SE proﬁ le.\\nTreating relapses:  Methylprednisolone, eg 0.5–1g/24h IV/PO for 3–5d shortens acute \\nrelapses; use sparingly (\\ue005 twice/yr; steroid SE, p377). It doesn’t alter overall prognosis.\\nSymptom control:  Spasticity: off er baclofen or gabapentin. Tizanidine or dant-\\nrolene are 2nd line; if these fail consider benzodiazepines. Tremor: botulinum toxin \\ntype A injections improve arm tremor and functioning.   Urgency/frequency: if post-\\nmicturition residual urine >100mL, teach intermittent self-catheterization; if <100mL, \\ntry tolterodine.

On examination the pa-\\ntients will be unable to wrinkle their forehead, conﬁ rming LMN pathology (see p70), \\nor whistle (tests buccinator). Other symptoms of VIIth palsy (from any cause):  \\n• Unilateral sagging of the mouth.• Drooling of saliva. • Food trapped between gum \\nand cheek. • Speech diffi  cult y. • Failure of eye closure may cause a watery or dry eye, \\nectr\\nopion (sagging and turning-out of the lower lid), injury from foreign bodies, or \\nconjunctivitis.\\nOther causes of VIIth palsy Account for ~ 30% of facial palsies. Think of these \\nif: rashes, bilateral symptoms, UMN signs, other cranial nerve involvement, or limb \\nweakness. Infective: Ramsay Hunt syndrome ( BOX), Lyme disease, meningitis, TB, \\nviruses (HIV, polio). Brainstem lesions: Stroke, tumour, MS. Cerebellopontine angle \\ntumours: Acoustic neuroma, meningioma. Systemic disease: DM, sarcoidosis, Guil-\\nlain–Barré. Local disease: Orofacial granulomatosis, parotid tumours, otitis media or  \\ncholesteatoma, skull base trauma.\\n\\ue007Lyme disease, Guillain–Barré, sarcoid, and trauma often cause bilateral weakness.\\nTests Rule out the other causes: Blood: ESR; glucose; \\ue000 Borrelia antibodies in Lyme \\ndisease, \\ue000 VZV antibodies in Ramsay Hunt syndrome ( BOX).

Of those with complete paralysis ~80% make a full \\nspontaneous recovery, but ~15% have axonal degeneration (~50% in pregnancy) in \\nwhich case recovery is delayed, starting after ~3 months, and may be comp licated \\nby aberrant reconnect ions: synkinesis, eg eye blinking causes synchronous upturn-\\ning o\\nf the mouth; misconnection of parasympathetic ﬁ  bres (red in ﬁ g 10.26) can \\nproduce crocodile tears (gusto –lacrimal reﬂ ex) when eating stim ulates unilateral \\nlacrimation, not salivation.\\nManagement Drugs: If given within 72h of onset, prednisolone (eg 60mg/d PO for \\n5d, tailing by 10mg/d) speeds recovery, with 95% making a full recovery. Antivirals \\n(eg aciclovir) don’t help; although some cases are thought to be associated with \\nHSV–1, no one has shown actively replicating virus. There are little data to guide treat-\\nment if presenting after 72h of onset, but cortico steroids are widely used (though SE, \\np377). No advice on the use of steroids is universally agreed in pregnancy.

The clinical features depend \\non the location o\\nf the lesion: At the wrist: (Eg see BOX ‘Carpal tunnel syndrome’.) \\nWeakness of abductor pollicis brevis and sensory loss over the radial 3½ ﬁ ngers and \\npalm. Anterior interosseous nerve lesions: (Eg trauma.) Weakness of ﬂ  exion of the \\ndistal phalanx of the thumb and index ﬁ nger. Proximal lesions: (Eg compression at \\nthe elbo\\nw.) May show combined defects.\\nUlnar nerve C 7–T1 Vulnerable to elbow trauma. Signs: Weakness/wasting of \\nmedial (ulnar side) wrist ﬂ \\nexors, interossei (cannot cross the ﬁ ng ers in the good \\nluck sign), and medial two lumbricals (claw hand, more marked in wrist lesions with \\ndigitorum profundus intact); hypothenar emin ence wasting, weak 5th digit abduction, \\nand 4th and 5th DIP joint ﬂ  exion; sensory loss over medial 1½ ﬁ ngers and ulnar side of \\nthe hand. Treatment: see BOX ’Managing ulnar mononeuropathies from entrapments’.\\nRadial nerve C5–T1 This nerve opens the ﬁ st. It may be damaged by compression \\nagainst the humerus. Signs: Test for wrist and ﬁ nger drop with elbow ﬂ exed and \\narm pronated; sensory loss is variable—the dorsal aspect of the root of the thumb \\n(the anatomical snuff  box) is most reliably aff  ected. Muscles involved: (‘ BEAST’) \\nbrachioradialis; extensors; abductor pollicis longus; supinator; triceps.\\nBrachial plexus Pain/paraesthesiae and weakness in the aff ected arm in a vari-\\nable distribution. Causes: Trauma, radiotherapy (eg for breast carcinoma), pro-\\nlonged w\\nearing of a heavy rucksack, cervical rib, thoracic outlet compression (also \\naff \\nects vasculature), or neuralgic amyotrophy ( Parsonage–Turner syndrome: uni-\\nlateral sudden, severe pain, follow ed over hours by profound w eakness, resolv-\\ning completely over days. May rarely involve the phrenic or lower cranial nerves.)\\nPhrenic nerve C 3–5 C3, 4, 5 keeps the diaphragm alive: lesions cause orthopnoea \\nwith a raised hemidiaphragm on CXR.

Compres-\\nsion is common, especially in w\\nomen who have narrower wrists but similar-sized \\ntendons to men.\\nClinical features: Aching pain in the hand and arm (especially at night), and par-\\naesthesiae in thumb, inde\\nx, and middle ﬁ ngers: relieved by dangling the hand over \\nthe edge of the bed and shaking it (remember ‘wake and shake’). There may be \\nsensory loss and weakness of abductor pollicis brevis ± wasting of the thenar emi-\\nnence. Light touch, \\n2-point discrimination, and sweating may be impaired.\\nCauses: Anything causing swelling or compression of the tunnel: myxoedema; \\npr\\nolonged ﬂ  exion (eg in a Colles’ splint); acromegaly; myeloma; local tumours \\n(lipomas, ganglia); rheumatoid arthritis; amyloidosis; pregnancy; sarcoidosis.\\nTests: Neurophysiology helps by conﬁ  rming the lesion’s site and severity (and like-\\nlihood of improvement after surgery). Maximal wrist ﬂ exion for 1 min (Phalen’s \\ntest) may elicit symptoms, and tapping over the nerve at the wrist can induce \\ntingling (Tinel’s test) but both are rather non-speciﬁ c.\\nTreatment: Splinting, local steroid injection ± decomp r ession surgery.\\nNB: There is also t arsal tunnel syndrome: unilateral burning sole pain following \\ntibial nerve compression.\\nCarpal tunnel syndrome: the commonest mononeuropathy\\nThe ulnar nerve asks for trouble in at least ﬁ  ve places at the elbow, starting \\nproximally at the arcade of Struthers (a musculofascial band ~ 8cm proximal to \\nthe medial epicondyle), and ending distally where it exits the ﬂ  exor carpi ulnaris \\nmuscle in the forearm.\\n  Most often, compression occurs at the epicondylar groove  \\nor at the point where the nerve passes between the two heads of ﬂ exor carpi ul-\\nnaris (true cubital tunnel syndrome). Trauma can easily damage the nerve against \\nits bony conﬁ  nes (the medial condyle of the humerus—the ‘funny bone’). Normally, \\nstretch and compression forces on the ulnar nerve at the elbow are moderated \\nby its ability to glide in its groove. When normal excursion is restricted, irritation \\nensues. This may cause a vicious cycle of perineural scarring, consequent loss of \\nexcursion, and progressive symptoms\\n—without antecedent trauma. Compressive \\nulnar neuropathies at the wrist (Guyon’s canal—between the pisiform and hamate \\nbones) are less common, but they can also result in disability.\\nTreatment centres on rest and avoiding pressure on the nerve, but if symp-\\nt\\noms cont inue, night-time soft elbow splinting (to prevent ﬂ  exion >60°) is \\nwarranted. A splint for the hand may help prevent permanent clawing of \\nthe ﬁ ngers. For chronic neuropathy associated with weakness, or if splint-\\ning fails, a variety of surgical procedures have been tried. For moderately se-\\nvere neuropathies, decompressions in situ may help, but often fail. Medial \\nepicondylectomies  are eff ective in \\ue005\\n50% (but many will recur). Subcutaneous \\nnerve re-routing (transposition) may be tried.\\nManaging ulnar mononeuropathies from entrapments\\n_OHCM_10e.indb   503_OHCM_10e.indb   503 02/05/2017   19:0802/05/2017   19:08'),\n",

For example, Guillain\\n–\\nBarré syndrome (p702) is an acute, predominantly motor, demyelinating neurop athy, \\nwhereas chronic alcohol abuse leads to a chronic, initially sensory then mixed, axonal \\nneuropathy.\\nDiagnosis The history is vital: be clear about the time course, the precise nature of \\nthe s\\nymptoms, and any preceding or associated events (eg D&V before Guillain–Barré \\nsyndrome; \\ue001weight in cancer; arthralgia from a connective tissue disease). Ask about \\ntravel, alcohol and drug use, sexual infections, and family history. If there is palpable \\nnerve thickening think of leprosy or Charcot\\n–Marie–Tooth. Examine other systems \\nfor clues to the cause, eg alcoholic liver disease.\\nTests FBC, ESR, glucose, U&E, LFT, TSH, B12, electrophoresis, ANA, ANCA, CXR, urinalysis, \\nconsider LP ± speciﬁ c genetic tests for inherited neuropathies, lead level, antigan-\\nglioside antibodies. Nerve conduction studies distinguish demyelinating from ax-\\nonal causes.\\nSensory neuropathy: (Eg \\nDM, CKD, leprosy.) Numbness; pins and needles, paraesthe-\\nsiae; aff ects ‘glove and stocking’ distribution. Diffi  culty handling small objects such \\nas buttons.

Upper and lower motor neurons can be aff  ected but there is no  \\nsensory loss or sphincter disturbance, thus distinguishing MND from MS and poly-\\nneuropathies. MND never aff ects eye movements, distinguishing it from myasthenia \\n(p512). There are four clinical patterns:\\n1       ALS/amyotrophic lateral sclerosis.  (Archetypal MND; up to 80%.) Loss of motor \\nneurons in motor cortex and the anterior horn of the cord, so combined UMN + LMN \\nsigns (p446). Worse prognosis if: bulbar onset, \\ue000age; \\ue001FVC.\\n2   P rogressive bulbar palsy. ( 10–20%.) Only aff  ects cranial nerves IX–XII. See BOX \\n‘Bulbar and corticobulbar (‘pseudobulbar’) palsy’.\\n3   P rogressive muscular atrophy. ( <10%.) Anterior horn cell lesion, so LMN signs \\nonly. Aff ects distal muscle groups before proximal. Better prognosis than ALS.\\n4   P rimary lateral sclerosis.  (Rare.) Loss of Betz cells in motor cortex: mainly UMN \\nsigns, marked spastic leg weakness and pseudobulbar palsy. No cognitive decline.\\nPresentation Think of MND in those >40yrs (median UK age at onset is 60) with stum-\\nbling spastic gait, foot-drop ± proximal myopathy, weak grip (door-handles don’t \\nturn) and shoulder abduction (hair-washing is hard), or aspiration pneumonia. Look \\nfor \\nUMN signs: spasticity, brisk reﬂ exes, \\ue000plantars; and LMN signs: wasting, fascic-\\nulation of tongue, abdomen, back, thigh. Is speech or swallowing aff ected (bulbar \\nsigns)? Fasciculation is not enough to diagnose an LMN lesion: look for weakness too. \\nFrontotemporal dementia occurs in ~25% (see BOX ‘Dignity and Dignitas’).\\nDiagnostic criteria (See BOX ‘Revised El Escorial diagnostic criteria for ALS’). There \\nis no diagnostic test. Brain/cord MRI helps exclude structural causes, LP helps exclude \\ninﬂ ammatory ones, and neurophysiology can detect subclinical denervation and help \\nexclude mimicking motor neuropathies.14\\nPrognosis Poor, <3yrs post onset in half of patients.\\nManagement Adopt a multidisciplinary approach: neurologist, palliative nurse,  \\nhosp ice, physio, OT, speech therapist, dietician, social services —all orchestrated by \\nthe GP. Riluzole, an inhibitor of glutamate release and NMDA receptor antagonist, \\nis the only medication shown to improve survival. Mulitple other drugs that have \\nshown promise in animal models have failed to prove beneﬁ  t in clinical trials, includ-\\ning neurotrophic factors, anti-apoptotic agents, antioxidants, and immunomodu-\\nlatory drugs. For supportive/symptomatic treatment: Excess saliva: Advise on \\npositioning, or\\nal care, and suctioning. Try an antimuscarinic (eg propantheline) or \\ngly\\ncopyrronium bromide (can be given SC). Botulinum toxin A may help. Dysphagia: \\nBlend food. Gastrostomy is an option—discuss early on. Spasticity: Exercise, orthot-\\nics. See MS for drugs (p496). Communication difﬁ cult y: Provide ‘augmentative and \\nalt\\nernative’ communication equipment. End-of-life care: \\ue007Involve palliative care \\nt\\neam from diagnosis (p532). Consider opioids to relieve breathlessness and discuss  \\nnon-invasive ventilation (see BOX ‘Dignity and Dignitas’). \\n14 If no UMN signs and distal arm muscles are aff  ected in the distribution of individual nerves, suspect \\nmultifocal motor neuropathy with conduction block (diagnose on nerve conduction studies; \\ue057: IV Ig). \\nGyn aeco mastia, atrophic testes ± infertility suggests Kennedy syndrome (bulbospinal muscular atrophy). \\n_OHCM_10e.indb   506_OHCM_10e.indb   506 02/05/2017   19:0802/05/2017   19:08'),\n",

In favour of myopathy:  •Gradual onset of sym-\\nmetric pr\\noximal weakness—diffi  culty combing hair and climbing stairs (NB: weakness \\nis also distal in myotonic dystrophy). •Speciﬁ c muscle groups aff  ected (ie selective \\nweakness on ﬁ rst presentation). •Preserved tendon reﬂ e xes. •No paraesthesiae or \\nbladder pr\\noblems. •No fasciculation (suggests anterior horn cell or root disease).\\nR\\napid onset suggests a toxic, drug, or metabolic myopathy (or a neuropathy). \\nExcess fatigability ( \\ue000weakness with exercise) suggests myasthenia (p512). Sponta-\\nneous pain at rest and local tenderness occurs in inﬂ ammatory myopathies. Pain on \\nexercise suggests ischaemia or metabolic myopathy (eg McArdle’s disease). Oddly \\nﬁ rm muscles (due to inﬁ  ltrat ions with fat or connective tissue) suggest pseudo-\\nhyper tro phic muscular dystroph ies (eg Duchenne’s).\\nTests ESR, CK, AST, and LDH may be raised. Do EMG and tests relevant to systemic \\ncauses (eg TSH, p216). Muscle biopsy and genetic testing may help reach a diagnosis.\\nMuscular dystrophies A group of genetic diseases (see table 10.12) with progres-\\nsive degeneration and weakness of speciﬁ  c muscle groups. The primary abnormal-\\nity may be in the muscle membrane. There may be unusually ﬁ  rm muscles due to \\ninﬁ ltrat ion by fat or connective tissue, and marked variation in size of individual \\nmuscle ﬁ bres on histology. • Duchenne’\\n s muscular dystrophy: The commonest \\n(3/1000 male live births). Presents at ~4yrs old with clumsy walking, then diffi   -\\nculty in standing, and respiratory failure. Pseudohypertrophy is seen, especially in \\nthe calves. Serum creatine kinase \\ue000 \\n>40-fold. There is no speciﬁ c treatment. Some \\nsurvive beyond 20yrs. Home ventilation improves prognosis. Genetic counselling is \\nvital. • Beck er’s muscular dystrophy: (~ 0.3/1000 \\ue032 births.) Presents similarly to \\nDuchenne’s but with milder symptoms, at a later age, and with a better prognosis. \\n• F acioscapulohumeral muscular dystro phy: (FSHD, Landouzy–Dejerine.) Almost as \\ncommon as Duchenne’s. Onset is ~12–14yrs old, with inability to puff  out the cheeks \\nand diffi   culty raising the arms above the head. Signs: weakness of face (‘ironed out’ \\nexpression), shoulders, and upper arms (often asymmetric with deltoids spared), \\nfoot-drop, scapular winging (ﬁ g \\n10.31),   scoliosis, anterior axillary folds, and horizon-\\ntal clavicles. \\ue00520% need a wheelchair by 40yrs.\\nMyotonic disorders Cause tonic muscle spasm (myotonia), and demonstrate long \\nchains o\\nf central nuclei within muscle ﬁ bres on histology. The commonest is myo-\\nt\\nonic dystrophy which is, in fact, clinically and genetically heterogeneous, with two \\nmajor f\\norms (DM1 and DM2—see table 10.12), both showing abnormal trinucleotide \\nrepeat expansions in regulatory (non-coding) genetic regions. DM1 is the commoner, \\nmore severe, and typically presents between 20–40 yrs old with distal  weakness \\n(hand/foot drop), weak sternomastoids, and myotonia. Facial weakness and muscle \\nwasting give a long, haggard appearance. Also: cataracts, male frontal baldness, \\ndiabetes, testis/ovary atrophy, cardiomyopathy, and \\ue001cognition. Most DM1 patients \\ndie in late middle age of respiratory or cardiac complications. Mexiletine may help \\nwith disabling myotonia. Genetic counselling is important.\\nInﬂ amma\\ntory myopathies There may be spontaneous muscle pain at rest \\nand local t\\nenderness on palpation.  Inclusion body m yositis is the chief example \\nif aged >50yrs. Weakness starts with quadriceps, ﬁ  nger ﬂ exors, or pharyngeal \\nmuscles. Ventral extremity muscle groups are more aff ected than dorsal or girdle \\ngroups. Response to therapy is poor and patients typically progress over a decade \\nto require assistance with activites of daily living. Histology shows ringed vacuoles \\n+ intranuclear inclusions. Polymyositis and dermatomyositis, see p 552.\\nMetabolic myopathies Eg McArdle’s disease  (glycogen storage disorder). Pre-\\nsents with muscle pain and w\\neakness after exercise.\\nAcquired myopathies of late onset Often part of systemic disease —eg hyper-\\nthyroidism, malignancy, Cushing’s, hypo- and hypercalcaemia.\\nDrug causes Alcohol; statins; steroids; chloroquine; zidovudine; vincristine; cocaine. \\n_OHCM_10e.indb   510_OHCM_10e.indb   510 02/05/2017   19:0802/05/2017   19:08'),\n",

At the neuromuscular junction ( NMJ) this is acetylcholine (ACh). Each \\nvesicle contains ~8000 ACh molecules.\\n2       When an action potential arrives at the pre-synaptic terminal, depolarization \\nopens voltage-gated Ca2+ channels (VGCCS). In Lambert–Eaton syndrome, anti-\\nP/Q type VGCC antibodies disrupt this stage of synaptic transmission.15\\n3       Inﬂ ux of Ca2+ through the VGCCs triggers fusion of synaptic vesicles with the \\npre-synaptic membrane (a process that botulinum toxin  interferes with), and \\nneurotransmitter is released from the vesicles into the synaptic cleft.\\n4       Transmitter molecules cross the synaptic cleft by diff  usion and bind to re-\\nceptors on the post-synaptic membrane, causing depolarization of the post-\\nsynaptic membrane (the end-plate potential). This change in the post-synaptic \\nmembrane triggers muscle contraction at the NMJ, or onward transmission of \\nthe action potential in neurons. In myasthenia gravis , antibodies block the \\npost-synaptic ACh receptors, preventing the end-plate potential from becom-\\ning large enough to trigger muscle contraction—and muscle weakness ensues.\\n5       Transmitter action is terminated by enzyme-induced degradation of transmit-\\nter (eg acetylcholinesterase), uptake into the pre-synaptic terminal or glial \\ncells, or by diff usion away from s ynapse. Anticholinesterase treatments for\\nmyasthenia gravis, such as pyridostigmine , reduce the rate of degradation of \\nACh, increasing the chance that it will trigger an end-plate potential.\\nHow synapses work—the neuromuscular junction\\nFig 10.33 Lambert–Eaton syndrome fea-\\ntures pre-synaptic Ca2+-channel antibodies. \\nDepressed tendon reﬂ  exes are common, \\nbecause less transmitter is released, but re-\\nﬂ exes may \\ue000 after maximum voluntary con-\\ntraction due to a build of transmitter in the \\nsynaptic cleft (post-tetanic potentiation). \\nFig 10.32 Myasthenia gravis features post-synaptic \\nAChR antibodies. Tendon reﬂ  exes are normal be-\\ncause the synapses do not have time to become \\nfatigued with such a brief muscle contraction. \\nOcular palsies are common (it’s not exactly clear \\nwhy).\\n15 Disruption of pre-synaptic transmission aff  ects release of ACh in autonomic nervous system as well as \\nat neuromuscular junction, explaining the prominence of dysautonomia in LEMS unlike in MG.\\n_OHCM_10e.indb   513_OHCM_10e.indb   513 02/05/2017   19:0802/05/2017   19:08'),\n",

Local effects of \\nneuroﬁ bromas:  nerve root compression (weakness, pain, paraesthesiae); GI—bleeds, \\nobstruction; bone—cystic lesions, scoliosis, pseudarth rosis. \\ue000BP from renal artery ste-\\nnosis or phaeochromo cytoma. Plexiform neuroﬁ  bromas (large, subcutaneous swell-\\nings). Malignancy  (5% patients with NF1): optic glioma, sarcomatous change in a \\nneuroﬁ broma. \\ue000Epilepsy risk (slight). Rare association: carcinoid syndrome (p271).\\nManagement:  Multidisciplinary team with geneticist, neur ologist, sur geon, and \\nphysiotherapist, orchestrated by a GP. Yearly cutaneous survey and measurement \\nof BP. Dermal neuroﬁ bromas are unsightly, and catch on clothing; if troublesome, \\nexcise, but removing all lesions is unrealistic. Genetic counselling is vital (OHCS p154).\\nType 2 neuroﬁ bromatosis (NF2)\\nAutosomal dominant inheritance, though 50% are de novo, with mosaicism in some \\n(NF2 gene locus is 22q11). Rarer than NF1 with a prevalence of only 1 in 35 000.\\nSigns: Café-au-lait  spots are fewer than in NF1. Bilateral vestibular Schwannomas  \\n(= acoustic neuromas; p462) are characteristic, becoming symptomatic by ~20yrs old \\nwhen sensorineural hearing loss is the 1st sign. There may be tinnitus and vertigo. \\nThe rate of tumour growth is unpredictable and variable. The tumours are benign \\nbut cause problems by pressing on local structures and by \\ue000ICP. They may be absent \\nin mosaic NF2. Juvenile posterior subcapsular lenticular opacity  (a form of cata-\\nract) occurs before other manifest ations and can be useful in screening those at risk.\\nComplications: Tender Schwannomas of cranial and peripheral nerves, and spinal \\nnerve roots. Meningiomas (45% in NF2, often multiple). Glial tumours are less common. \\nConsider NF2 in any young person presenting with one of these tumours in isolation.\\nManagement:  Hearing tests yearly from puberty in aff ected families, with MRI brain \\nif abnormality is detected. A normal MRI in the late teens is helpful in assessing risk \\nto any off spring. A clear scan at 30yrs (unless a family history of late onset) indi-\\ncates that the gene has not been inherited. Treatment of vestibular Schwannomas is \\nneurosurgical and complicated by hearing loss/deterioration and facial palsy. Mean \\nsurvival from diagnosis is ~ 15yrs.\\nSchwannomatosis Multiple tender cutaneous Schw annomas without the bilat-\\neral vestibular Schwannomas that are characteristic of NF2. Indistinguishable from \\nmosaic NF2, where vestibular Schwannomas are also absent, except by genetic \\nanalysis of tumour biopsies. There is typically a large tumour load, assessable only \\nby whole-body MRI. Mutations in the tumour suppressor genes SMARCB1 and LZTR1 \\nand spontaneous NF2 mutations have all been described.  Life expectancy is normal.\\nFig 10.34 Multiple brown Lisch \\nnodul es on the iris. ©Jon Miles.\\n_OHCM_10e.indb   514_OHCM_10e.indb   514 02/05/2017   19:0802/05/2017   19:08'),\n",

Mean \\nage of onset: 30yrs. Incidence:  8/100 000/yr. Symptoms may be static for years, but \\nthen worsen fast—eg on coughing or sneezing, as \\ue000pressure causes extension, eg into \\nthe brainstem (syringobulbia, see later in topic).\\nCauses Typically, blocked CSF circulation (without 4th ventricular communic-\\nation), with \\ue001ﬂ ow from basal posterior fossa to caudal space, eg Arnold –Chiari \\nmalformation (cerebellum herniates through foramen magnum); basal arachnoidi-\\ntis (after infection, irradiation, subarachnoid haemorrhage); basilar invagination \\n(in which the top of the odontoid process of C2 migrates upwards, causing fora-\\nmen magnum stenosis ± medulla oblongata compression); masses (cysts, rheu-\\nmatoid pannus, encephalocoele, tumours). Less commonly , a syrinx may develop \\nafter myelitis, cord trauma, or rupture of an AV malformation, or within spinal \\ntumours (ependymoma or haemangioblastoma) due to ﬂ  uid secreted from neo-\\nplastic cells or haemorrhage.\\nSigns Dissociated sensory loss  (absent pain and T° sensation, with preserved \\nlight touch, vibration, and joint-position sense) due to pressure from the syrinx \\non the decussating antero lateral pathway (ﬁ g 10.35) in a root dis tribution reﬂ ect-\\ning the location of the syrinx (eg for typical cervical syrinx then sensory loss is \\nover trunk and arms); wasting/weakness  of hands ± claw-hand  (then arms\\ue003sho-\\nulders\\ue003respirat ory muscles).

Can have multiple neurological manifestations: these conditions \\nare part of the diff  erential diagnosis of meningitis, intra cranial mass lesions, demen-\\ntia, encephalomyelitis, cord problems, and peripheral neuropathies.\\nAcute infection: May be associated with transient aseptic meningoencephalitis \\n(typically self-limiting), myel opathy, and neuropathy.\\nOpportunistic infections:  Arise during low CD4 counts, which allow unusual or atyp-\\nical organisms to infect the nervous system: • Toxoplasma gondii (p400) is the main \\nCNS pathogen in AIDS, causing cerebral abscesses which present with focal signs, eg \\nseizures, hemiparesis. CT/MRI shows ring-shaped contrast-enhancing lesions. Treat \\nwith pyrimethamine (+folinic acid) + sulfadiazine or clindamycin for 6 months. Con-\\ntinue secondary prophylaxis until CD4 count >200. Pneumocys tis prophylaxis also \\nprotects against toxoplasmosis.  • Cryptococcus neo form ans (ﬁ g 10.36) causes a \\nchronic meningitis with fever and headache (neck stiff  ness may be absent). Cogni-\\ntion alters slowly, seizures and coma may follow. Treat with amphotericin followed \\nby ﬂ uconazole. • Cytomegalovirus ( CMV) can cause encephalopathy. • Progressive \\nmultifocal leukoencephalopathy ( PML) is caused by the JC virus. There is progres-\\nsive white matter inﬂ ammation. Mortality even with antiretroviral therapy is around \\n50% at 1yr. • Syphilis and TB may also cause meningitis.\\nTumours: Aff ecting the CNS include primary cerebral lymphoma (associated with EBV)\\nand B-cell lymphoma. CSF JC virus PCR is useful in distinguishing PML from lymphoma.\\nNeuropathies: Common in HIV, and may be a result of the disease itself or antiret-\\nroviral therapy. Up to 30% of patients have a peripheral neuropathy, which is pain-\\nful and predominantly sensory. Other clinical pictures include polyradiculopathy, \\nmononeuritis multiplex, and proximal myopathy.\\nChronic HIV-associated neurocognitive disorder ( HAND): While antiretroviral ther-\\napy (ART) has decreased the incidence of CNS complications in HIV/ AIDS, people are \\nliving longer with the disease, and chronic complications such as HIV-associated de-\\nmentia are increasing. This occurs in 7–15%, late in the disease, and usually when the \\nCD4 count is <200. Progressive behavioural changes are seen along with subcortical \\nfeatures: memory loss, poor attention, and bradykinesia. Various encephalopathies \\nmay also contribute to this, eg PML.\\nHuman T-cell lymphotrophic virus (HTLV-1) Is another retrovirus with neurologi-\\ncal manifestations, though much more rarely than HIV (~0.5%). It causes: Tropical \\nspastic paraplegia,  a slowly progressing myelopathy, typically aff ecting the tho-\\nracic area. There may be paraesthesiae, sensory loss, and disorders of micturition. \\nDemyelinating polyneuropathy  and ataxia may also occur.\\nFig 10.36 Cryptococcosis: (a) Chronic meningitis involving the basal leptomeningitis with multiple \\nsmall intraparenchymal cysts seen in the cerebral cortex.

Yet ‘cancer’ is not a homogenous disease but \\na group of conditions with prognoses ranging from very good (98% 10yr survival \\nfor testicular cancer) to extremely poor (21% 1yr survival for pancreatic cancer).1\\nCommunication2 is the ﬁ rst step on a cancer pathway and underpins whatever \\nthat diagnosis may subsequently entail for the individual. A range of overwhelm-\\ning feelings can surface upon receiving a cancer diagnosis: shock, numbness, deni-\\nal, panic, anger, resignation (‘I knew all along…’). Preconceptions, possibly derived \\nvicariously from friends and family, may be deeply embedded leading to despair \\nor inappropriate optimism. Without an understanding of your patient’s starting \\npoint, you may fail to be eff  ective in your guidance and support.\\nTips for the discussion of a cancer diagnosis\\n1\\n      Set the environment up carefully. Choose a quiet place where you will not be \\ndisturbed. Mak\\ne sure family or friends are present according to your patient’s \\nwishes. Anticipate likely questions and be sure of your facts.\\n2       Find out what the patient already knows and believes (often a great deal). \\n‘What ar\\ne you worried about today?’\\n3       Give some warning: ‘There is some bad news for us to address’.\\n4       Ascertain how much the person wants to know. ‘Are you someone who likes \\nt\\no know all the details about your condition?’ Although information is a prior-\\nity for the majority of cancer patients, this may change with the individual, \\nand the course of the disease. ‘Monitors’ will seek information, ‘blunters’ will \\ndistract themselves.\\n5       Share information about diagnosis and treatments. Speciﬁ cally list support-\\ning people (oncology multidisciplinary t\\neam) and institutions (hospices). Break \\ninformation down into manageable chunks and check understanding for each.\\n6       Invite questions patients may feel they cannot ask. ‘Is there anything else you \\nw\\nant me to explain?’ Do not hesitate to go over the same ground repeatedly. \\nAllow denial, don’t force the pace, give time. Listen to any concerns raised, \\nencourage the airing of feelings. Empathize.\\n7       Address prognosis. Be honest. Doctors are often too optimistic. Encourage \\nan appr\\nopriate level of hope (see BOX ‘Spiritual pain’, p535), refer to an expert.\\n8       Make a plan. The desire to be involved in decisions about treatment is vari-\\nable: y\\nour patient’s locus of control can be internal (desire control of their \\nown destiny) or external (passive acceptance). Decision-making can be im-\\nmediate, deferred, panicked, or rationally deliberated. Time may be required \\nto facilitate any style of decision-making: your plan may be simply to come \\nback and talk again.\\n9       Summarize, and off \\n er availability. Record details of your conversation includ-\\ning the language used.\\n10      Follow through. \\ue007Leave your patient with the knowledge that you are with \\nthem, and that y\\nour unwritten contract will not be broken.\\nNo rules guarantee success. Use whatever your patient gives you—closely observe \\nboth verbal and non-verbal cues. Getting to know your patient, seeking out the \\nright expert for each stage of treatment, and making an agreed management \\nplan, are all required.\\nFor any situation which involves the communication of bad news, consider \\nSPIKES:\\n3\\n  • Setting up the interview.\\n  • Assess the patient’s Perception of the situation.\\n  • Obtain an Invitation (asking the patient’s permission to explain).\\n  • Give Knowledge and information to the patient.\\n  • Address the Emotional response with Empathy.\\n  • Strategy and Summary: aim for consensus with patient and family.\\nLooking after people with cancer\\n_OHCM_10e.indb   519_OHCM_10e.indb   519 02/05/2017   19:0802/05/2017   19:08'),\n",

These \\ncells need to be able to adapt and change so that diff  erent tissues and organs \\ncan be formed. They need to command their own blood supply. Without extensive \\nmechanisms to control cell growth and prevent the replication of abnormal cells, \\nthese requirements for life become the basis for the development of a cancer. \\nFailure of control mechanisms causes cancer.\\nCancer is a genetic disease. Genetic changes occur in pathways associated with \\ncell growth, cell diff erentiation, and cell death. Mutations can be inherited or ac-\\nquired. Acquired or somatic errors occur due to age, exposure to carcinogens, and \\nin unchecked rapid cell turnover. Mutations result in:\\n  • ‘gain of function’ oncogenes  that have pathological activity in the absence of a \\nrelevant signal. For example, ras is a protein involved in signal transduction. It is \\nmutated in ~30% of human cancers. Oncogenes behave in a dominant manner: \\nmutation to one allele results in unchecked activation.\\n  • ‘loss of function’ tumour suppressor genes  no longer act as inhibitors of pro-\\nmalignant processes. In most cases, mutations to both alleles must occur for a \\ncancer phenotype. This can occur either as two separate somatic events, or in \\nthe case of predisposition genes, the ﬁ rst ‘hit’ is inherited and the second oc-\\ncurs somatically. Tumours therefore occur earlier and more frequently in familial \\ncancers. p53 is a tumour suppressor gene mutated in ~50% of human cancers.\\nMost cancers arise from multiple mutations.

In modern-\\nday use, the term refers primarily to the use of cytotoxic drugs in the treatment of \\ncancer. The aim is to deliver enough cytotoxic drug to a cancer-cell target which \\nis expressed diff erently compared to normal tissue. Cytotoxic drugs are given at \\nintervals (cycles of treatment) to allow recovery of normal tissue. Chemotherapy is \\nthe only systemic treatment for cancer (surgery and radiotherapy are local treat-\\nments). This is important as most cancers are considered to be systemic either due \\nto metastases, or the potential to metastasize in the future. \\ue007Chemotherapy should \\nbe pr\\nescribed and given only under expert guidance by people trained in its use.\\nIncludes:\\n  • Single-agent: R arely curative as genetically resistant cells are selected out.\\n  • Combination chemo therapy: A combination of drugs with diff er ent mechanisms \\nof action and diff erent side-eff  ect proﬁ les reduces the likelihood of resistance and \\ntoxicity. The drugs used should have:\\n  • cytotoxic activity for that tumour, preferentially able to induce remission\\n  • diff erent mechanisms of action, ideally additive or synergistic eff ects\\n  • non-overlapping toxicity to maximize beneﬁ  t of full therapeutic doses\\n  • diff erent mechanisms of resistance.\\n  • A djuvant: After other initial treatment to reduce the risk of relapse, eg following \\nsur\\ngical removal of, eg breast, bowel cancer.\\n  • Neoadjuv ant: Used t o shrink tumours prior to surgical or radiological treatment. \\nMay allow later treatment to be more conservative.\\n  • P alliative:  No curative aim, off ers symptom relief, may prolong survival.\\nClasses of cytotoxic drugs\\n  • Alk\\nylating agents: Anti-proliferative drugs that bind via alkyl groups to DNA lead-\\ning to apoptotic cell death, eg cyclophosphamide, chlorambucil, busulfan.\\n  • Angiogenesis inhibit ors: E g bevacizumab, aﬂ ibercept, sunitinib.\\n  • Antime tabolites: Interfere with cell metabolism including DNA and protein synthe-\\nsis, eg methotrexate, 5-ﬂ uorouracil.\\n  • Antioes trogens: Ar omatoase inhibitors (eg letrozole, anastrozole), oestrogen \\nreceptor antagonists (eg tamoxifen, raloxifene) used in breast cancer treatment.\\n  • Antitumour antibio tics: Interrupt DNA function, eg dactinomycin, doxorubicin, \\nmitomycin, bleomycin.\\n  • Monoclonal antibodies: Antibodies to a speciﬁ  c tumour antigen can slow tumour \\ngrowth by enhancing host immunity, or be conjugated with chemotherapy/radioac-\\ntive isotopes to allow targeted treatment. Expect more of these in future.\\n  • T\\nopoisomerase inhibitors: Int errupt regulation of DNA winding, eg etoposide.\\n  • V inca alkaloids and taxanes: ‘Spindle poisons’ which target mechanisms of cell \\ndivision, eg vincristine, vinblastine, doceta\\nxel.\\nSide-eff ects\\nDue to cytotoxic eff ects on non-cancer cells.

It uses ionizing radiation to cause damage to DNA. This \\nprevents cell division and leads to cell death. The aim of radiotherapy treatment is to \\ninactivate cancer cells without causing a severe reaction in normal tissue.\\nRadical treatment Given with curative intent. Total dose ranges from 40–70 gray \\n(Gy) in up to 40 fractions. Some regimens involve several smaller fractions a day \\nwith a gap of 6–8h. Combined chemoradiation is used in some sites, eg anus and \\noesophagus, to increase response rate.\\nPalliative radiotherapy Aims to relieve symptoms, may not impact on survival. \\nDoses ar\\ne smaller and given in fewer fractions to off er short-term tumour control \\nwith minimal side-eff ects. Palliation is used for brain metastases, spinal cord com-\\npression, visceral compression, and bleeding, eg haemoptysis, haematuria.

Improves ~ 4 weeks after treatment completed but chronic in \\n~30%. Advise patients to stay as active as possible.\\n  • Skin r eactions:  Include erythema, dry desquamation, moist desquamation, and \\nulcer\\nation. Aqueous cream can be used on unbroken areas.\\n  • Mucositis: All patients receiving head and neck treatment should have a dental \\ncheck\\n-up before therapy. Avoid smoking. Antiseptic mouthwashes may help. Aspi-\\nrin gargle and other soluble analgesics can be tried.

Suspect in all patients who are \\nunwell and within 6wks of receiving chemotherapy. Localizing signs may be absent. \\nExamine indwelling catheter sites. \\ue022Immediate treatment saves lives. Use local \\nguidelines or treat empirically with piperacillin/tazobactam (see p352).\\nSpinal cord compression\\n3–5% of cancer patients have spinal metastases. ~15% of those with advanced can-\\ncers develop metastatic spinal cord compression. Most commonly associated with \\nlung, prostate, breast, myeloma, melanoma. \\ue022Urgent treatment is required to pre-\\nserve neurological function and relieve pain.\\nCauses: Collapse or compression of a vertebral body due to metastases (common), \\ndir\\nect extension of a tumour into vertebral column (rare).\\nSigns and symptoms:  Back pain in ~95%. Ask about nocturnal pain and pain with \\nstraining. Worry if there is cervical/thoracic pain. Also limb weakness, diffi   culty \\nwalking, sensory loss, bowel/bladder dysfunction. Maintain a high index of suspicion.\\nManagement: Admit for bed rest and arrange urgent (within 24h) MRI of the whole \\nspine. Give dexamethasone 16mg/24h PO with prophylatic gastroprotection, eg PPI, \\nand blood glucose monitoring. If reduced mobility consider thromboprophylaxis \\n(compression stockings, \\nLMWH). Refer urgently to clinical oncology/cancer MDT. Ra-\\ndiotherapy is the commonest treatment and should be given within 24 hours of MRI \\ndiagnosis. Decompressive surgery ± radiotherapy may be appropriate depending on \\nprognosis. Patients with loss of motor function after \\n>48h are unlikely to recover \\nfunction. (See also p466.)\\nSuperior vena cava (SVC) syndrome\\nReduced venous return from head, neck, and upper limbs. Due to extrinsic compres-\\nsion (most common), or v\\nenous thrombosis (consider if current or past central ve-\\nnous access). \\ue022SVC syndrome with airway compromise requires urgent treatment.\\nCauses: >90% of SVC syndrome results from malignancy. Most common cancers: \\nlung (~75%), lymphoma, metastatic (eg breast), thymoma, germ cell.\\nSigns and symptoms: Diagnosis is made clinically. SOB, orthop noea, stridor, pleth-\\nora/cyanosis, oedema of face and arm, cough, headache, engorged neck veins (non-\\npulsatile \\ue000\\nJVP), engorged chest wall veins. Pemberton’s test: 1 elevation of the arms \\nto the side of the head causes facial plethora/cyanosis.\\nManagement: Prop up. Assess for hypoxia (pulse oximetry, blood gas) and give \\no\\nxygen if needed. Dexamethasone 16mg/24h. CT is used to deﬁ ne the anatomy of \\nthe obstruction. Balloon venoplasty and SVC stenting provide the most rapid relief \\nof symptoms (see BOX ‘Interventional oncology’, p 527). Treat with radiotherapy or \\nchemotherapy depending on the sensitivity of the underlying cancer.\\nMalignancy-associated hypercalcaemia\\nMost common metabolic abnormality in cancer patients: ~10–20% of patients with \\ncancer, ~40% of myeloma. It is a poor prognostic sign: 75% mortality within 3 \\nmonths. Calcium is highly protein-bound and needs correcting to the serum albumin \\nconcentration. PTH levels should be suppressed (see pp676–7).\\nCauses: PTH-related protein produced by the tumour (see p529), local osteolysis, eg \\nmyeloma, tumour production of calcitriol.\\nSigns and symptoms:  Weight loss, anorexia, nausea, polydipsia, polyuria, constipa-\\ntion, abdominal pain, deh\\nydration, weakness, confusion, seizure, coma.\\nManagement: Aggressive rehydration. Bisphosphonates (if eGFR ≥30), eg zoledronic \\nacid IV, usually normalize calcium within 3 days and can be given as a repeated infu-\\nsion. Calcitonin produces a more rapid (2h) but short-term eff  ect and tolerance can \\ndevelop.

Men and women aged 60–74yrs are off ered faecal occult \\nblood testing every 2yrs.\\nScreening tests aim to pick out those who need further investigation to rule \\nout or diagnose a cancer, in the hope that earlier diagnosis and treatment result \\nin better outcomes. All screening tests come with risk: anxiety, harm/discomfort \\nfrom the test, cost, false positives resulting in further invasive tests, false nega-\\ntives conferring inappropriate reassurance when symptoms arise. When consider-\\ning screening an asymptomatic population the potential risks and beneﬁ ts need to \\nbe weighed carefully and the Wilson criteria (see p\\n23) should be satisﬁ ed.\\nShould PSA be used to screen for prostate cancer?\\nMost men with prostate cancer will have a high prostate-speciﬁ c antigen (PSA). The \\nhigher the PSA, the more likely cancer is. However, PSA is non-speciﬁ  c and also raised \\nin benign prostatic disease, BMI <25, recent ejaculation, recent rectal examination, \\nprostatitis, and UTI. 76% of patients with a raised PSA do not have cancer. Following \\nscreening tests (see PROMIS study, 2017, for use of multi-parametric MRI), prostate \\nbiopsy is required for diagnosis. This has an inherent risk of complications includ-\\ning bleeding, infection, and urinary retention.  ~1% will require hospital admission.\\nThe risks of PSA testing and subsequent biopsy need to be counterbalanced by \\nbeneﬁ ts from screening.15 ~1 in 800 men avoid death from prostate cancer as a re-\\nsult of PSA screening. But screening picks up many cancers that will never become \\nfatal. This ‘overdiagnosis’ is thought to occur in ~ 40% of positive screens with \\nsigniﬁ cant risks from treatment including urinary incontinence, erectile dysfunc-\\ntion, and IHD. This balance of risk versus beneﬁ t means that population screening \\nfor prostate cancer using PSA is not recommended.

Oral morphine is 1st-line. If the oral route is unavailable, use mor-\\nphine or diamorphine SC (see table 11.5, and tables 11.6, 11.7, p536). Explanation and \\nregular review are important. Prescribe anti-emetics and laxatives for all patients.\\nStart low, go slow: For an opioid-naïve patient with moderate to severe pain, con-\\nsider or\\nal morphine 5mg every 4 hours plus 5mg PRN (maximum hourly). Consider \\na lower starting dose if elderly, \\ue001BMI, or renal impairment. If pain is not controlled, \\n\\ue000 dose by 30–50% every 24h.\\nConvert to modiﬁ ed release: When pain is controlled, calculate the total daily \\ndose including PRN and divide into two 12h doses of a modiﬁ ed-release preparation \\n(eg MST Continus® 12h). Transdermal preparations are available: seek expert help \\nfor dose, check adhesion, and rotate site.\\nUse a PRN dose for breakthrough pain: 1/10th–1/6th of the total daily dose as an \\nimmediate-release preparation, eg Oramorph® or Sevredol®.\\nSide-effects: Drowsiness, nausea/vomiting (usually \\ue001 aft er 5 days), constipation, \\ndry mouth. If diffi  culty tolerating morphine, or pain plus toxicity, consider an opi-\\noid switch (eg oxycodone) and \\ue001 dose by 25–30%.\\nToxicity: Sedation, respiratory depression, visual hallucinations, myoclonic jerks, \\ndelirium. Be alert: r\\necognizing toxicity early usually means naloxone is avoided. \\nMonitor pulse oximetry, give oxygen if required.

In patients on regular opiates it can precipitate \\na pain crisis and potentially fatal acute withdrawal.18\\nRenal failure:  Patients with renal impairment (e GFR <30) are at risk of toxicity \\ndue to accumulation of renally excreted opioids and metabolites. Monitor closely. \\nFentanyl, alfentanil, and buprenorphine have predominantly hepatic metabolism \\n—seek expert advice.\\nConcerns: Patients may shrink from using opioids. Misconceptions are common: \\nthe\\ny are addictive, for the dying, if they use morphine now it will not work when \\nthey really need it. Respiratory depression is very rare when opioids are correctly \\ntitrated but opioids often get blamed when a patient deteriorates. Reassure pa-\\ntients that opioids are effective and safe when used appropriately.\\nMorphine-resistant pain: Seek expert help. Consider methadone, ketamine, and \\nadjuv\\nants such as NSAIDS, steroids, muscle relaxants, anxiolytics, nerve blocks. If \\nneuropathic pain is suspected, try amitriptyline, pregabalin, or topical lidocaine. \\nConsider the eff  ect of psychological and spiritual well-being on pain (see p\\n535).\\nRapid analgesia: Most PRN medication takes time to have an eff ect.

Anti-emetic choice \\nshould be based on the likely mechanism of nausea. Consider the site of anti-emetic \\naction, especially when using a combination of drugs.

Options include the following:\\n  • Cyclizine 50mg/8h: antihistamine, anticholinergic, central action so good for in-\\ntracranial disorders.\\n  • Metoclopramide 10–20mg/8h: blocks central chemoreceptor trigger zone, peripheral \\nprokinetic eff ects so good in gastroparesis, monitor for extra-pyramidal side-eff ects.\\n  • Domperidone 10–20mg/8h PO: peripheral antidopaminergic so no dystonic eff ects.\\n  • Haloperidol 1.5mg PO initially 1–2 times daily: dopamine antagonist, eff  ective in \\ndrug- or metabolically induced nausea, use lower doses IV/SC as twice as potent.\\n  • Ondansetron 4–8mg/8h: serotonin antagonist, good for chemo/radiotherapy-relat-\\ned nausea, may cause constipation.\\n  • Levomepromazine 6.25mg, initially 1–2 times daily: broad spectrum, but can sedate, \\nmay be very eff ective if fear/anxiety are contributing to symptoms.\\nAntisecretory drugs, such as hyoscine butylbromide or octreotide may be required \\nfor patients with vomiting and bowel obstruction: seek expert advice.\\nConstipation\\nCauses: Very common side-eff \\n ect of opioids. Better to prevent than treat so pre-\\nscribe laxatives for all patients starting opioids. Also hypercalcaemia (see p 528), \\ndehydration, drugs, or intra-abdominal disease.\\nTreatment: Treat reversible causes. Good ﬂ uid intake. Ensure privacy and access to \\ntoilet. Medication options include the following:\\n  • Stimulant (eg senna 2–4 tablets or bisacodyl 5–10mg) at night ± a softener (eg \\nsodium docusate 100mg BD).\\n  • Osmotic laxative (eg  macrogol).\\n  • Rectal treatments: bisacodyl/glycerol suppositories, phosphate enema.\\nBreathlessness\\nCauses: Look for reversible causes including infection, eff usion, anaemia, arrh\\n yth-\\nmia, thromboembolism. If stridor or signs of superior vena cava syndrome, treat \\nurgently (see p\\n528).\\nTreatment: Treat reversible causes as appropriate. Consider thoracocentesis ± pleu-\\nr\\nodesis for a pleural eff  usion. Recurrent pleural eff  usions may warrant a radiologi-\\ncally placed permanent drain (see p527). If the patient remains distressed, consider a \\ntrial of low-dose opioids. These reduce respiratory drive and the sensation of breath-\\nlessness. If opioid-naive, start with \\n2.5mg of an immediate-release morphine every \\n4h. If already taking an opioid, use the appropriate breakthrough dose (see p 533). \\nBenzodiazepines may help if associated anxiety, eg lorazepam 500mcg SL every 4–6h.\\nOral problems\\nCauses: Poor oral hygiene, radiation, drugs (anticholinergics, chemotherapy, diuret-\\nics), inf\\nection (candidiasis, herpes simplex).\\nTreatment: Oral candidiasis: topical miconazole, oral ﬂ uconaz ole 50mg OD but check \\nfor interactions (eg warfarin). Nystatin is often ineff ective and may exacerbate nau-\\nsea. Herpes simplex: oral gan/aciclovir. Good mouth care maintains comfort and \\nthe ability to communicate. Maintain ﬂ uid intake with frequent, small drinks. Sim-\\nple measures are often \\ue000 eff  ective: sugar-free chewing gum, normal saline mouth-\\nwashes, soft toothbrush. Products containing alcohol may sting. Salivary stimulants \\n(rather than substitutes) can be helpful for dry mouth, eg pilocarpine eye drops \\n4%, 3 drops in the ﬂ  oor of mouth QDS.

It relates to the way in which people \\nunderstand and live their lives. It is comprised of elements including meaning, \\npurpose, and something greater than ‘self’. It is distinct from faith, which is a \\nreligious experience, that may or may not be part of spirituality. Spiritual pain\\n20,21 \\nor suff ering is common when people are facing death. It can include feelings of \\nhopelessness, guilt, isolation, meaninglessness, and confusion. Consider:\\n  • the past: painful memories, guilt\\n  • the present: isolation, anger\\n  • the future: fear, hopelessness.\\nR\\neminiscence helps address the past, provides context, and off  ers recognition of \\nthe patient as an individual. Anger should be acknowledged. Fear of the imagined \\nfuture may not change, but is potentially reduced through discussion. The nature \\nof hope may need to be modiﬁ ed. If hope for a cure is inappropriate, it should not \\nbe the main or only hope. Realistic hopes include discharge from hospital, seeing \\nfamily members happy, being remembered. Making a will, handing over respon-\\nsibilities, and dealing with unﬁ  nished business facilitate control and may allow a \\nsense of completion.\\n\\ue007Remember the whole person: history, coping mechanisms, state of well-being. \\nElements such as these will alt\\ner how disease aff ects the patient and how the \\npatient responds to disease.\\n\\ue007Companionship is essential in spiritual support. At times a doctor needs to mod-\\nify their r\\nole to simply accompany the dying patient. This is manageable within \\nestablished professional boundaries and therapeutic.

Give pre-\\nscribed glucocorticoids in the morning. Avoid waking patients for late medications \\nand routine observations. Discuss and address psychosocial issues. In some cases \\nzopiclone or benzodiazepines may be used to help patients rest and re-establish \\nnormal sleep\\n–wake cycles (may exacerbate delirium).\\nPruritus\\nCauses: Systemic disease (renal failure, hepatitis, polycythaemia), cancer-related \\n(cholestasis, lymphoma, leuk\\naemia, hepatoma, myeloma, paraneoplastic), primary-\\nskin disease, drug reaction (opioids, SSRI, chemotherapy).\\nTreatment: Underlying causes where possible: cholestasis (biliary stenting, colestyr-\\namine, sertr\\naline, rifampicin), opioid-induced (antihistamine, opioid switch), para-\\nneoplastic (paroxetine). Topical emollients regularly and as a soap substitute. Avoid \\ntopical antihistamines due to risk of contact dermatitis.\\nVenepuncture\\nRepeated venepuncture with the risk of painful extravasation and phlebitis may be \\na\\nvoided by use of a central catheter (eg Hickman® tunnelled line or PICC).

This is distinct from euthanasia \\nwhere a doctor administers the lethal drug. There have been repeated attempts \\nto introduce physician-assisted dying (physician-assisted suicide only of the ter-\\nminally ill) into \\nUK law, but all have been rejected by Parliament.\\nConsider autonomy. Should competent patients have the right to determine \\ntheir death, especially if their situation is unbearable, without prospect of im-\\nprovement? It is a powerful argument. But bearable is subjective and prognosis is \\nan inexact science. And beneﬁ  cence is divided: is it merciful, or is it abandonment, \\nto end suff ering through death? And what of consent? Consent is key. Yet consent \\nis complex. Could a legal process help? Not without a unique understanding of \\neach patient and the means by which they experience life. A combination of law \\nand medicine may off  er false comfort without full accountability by either. Protec-\\ntion for the vulnerable is a valid concern for doctors and society.\\nRequests to hasten death are complex and include personal, psychological, spir-\\nitual, social, cultural, and demographic factors. ~\\n10% of terminally ill patients will \\nconsider euthanasia or physician-assisted suicide. These wishes may or may not \\nbe ﬁ xed, with ~\\n50% of patients changing their mind within 6 months. Discuss this. \\nAsk your patient how they feel today and what they are afraid of feeling tomor-\\nrow. Listen. Answer questions. Off  er palliative care. Palliative care is never futile. \\nA wish to die is associated with a need for information, reassurance, and compe-\\ntence in symptom control. Provide these, or ﬁ  nd someone who can.\\nOn wanting to die\\nManage agitation. Look for reversible causes (pain, dehydration, urinary retention). \\nUse an antips\\nychotic agent (eg haloperidol) to manage agitated delirium (see tables \\n11.6, 11.7). Try a benzodiazepine such as midazolam if there is a large element of anxi-\\nety. Opioids should not be used to sedate a dying patient.  Seek early advice from \\npalliative care if agitation is escalating or a signiﬁ cant problem.\\nManage excessive secretions.  Noise is generated by turbulent air ﬂ ow and pooling \\nof saliva in the hypopharynx. This may be more distressing for relatives and staff   \\nthan the patient. There is little evidence that pharmacological agents are beneﬁ cial, \\nthough they are commonly used. Repositioning and intermittent suctioning may \\nhelp. If you think the patient is distressed, consider a trial of an antisecretory drug \\n(glycopyrronium or hyoscine butylbromide: see tables \\n11.6, 11.7).\\nHydration. Many patients approaching the end of life are unable to eat/drink or \\nha\\nve a very poor appetite for food/ﬂ uid. Helping to take sips and good mouth care \\nmay suffi   ce. Fluid via non-oral routes (NG, SC, IV) is given for symptomatic beneﬁ t; the \\neff ect on survival is unknown. Any potential beneﬁ t must be weighed against the \\nrisk of symptomatic ﬂ uid overload. Discuss this with patients and families, explain-\\ning the pros and cons of hydration and the uncertainty of the eff ect of hydration on \\nsurvival:23 relatives may assume the patient is dying faster because of dehydration or \\nthat they will be suff ering with thirst. Make decisions about giving ﬂ  uids on a case-\\nby-case basis. Review a patient’s hydration status at least daily.\\nPlan for death. Ensure that a ‘Do not attempt resuscitation’ or ‘Allow natural death’, \\nor\\nder has been made. Discuss this with the patient (where appropriate), their family, \\nand/or others of importance to them. Document everything clearly. Do they want \\nto die at home? This can usually be arranged at very short notice with help from \\ndistrict nursing teams and community palliative care. Discuss transfer to a hospice \\nor nursing home if appropriate.\\nRespond to changes in the clinical situation. Patients who are thought to be at \\nthe end o\\nf their life occasionally improve. Be alert to signs of improvement, and be \\nprepared to switch back to active treatment when appropriate.\\nCommunicate. 23 The importance of clear and regular written and verbal commu-\\nnication with dying patients and their families cannot be overemphasized.  Find \\nout what is important to your patient. How much information do they know and \\nwant to know about their situation and prognosis? Be sensitive to social, religious, \\nand cultural issues.\\n_OHCM_10e.indb   537_OHCM_10e.indb   537 02/05/2017   19:0802/05/2017   19:08'),\n",

It is based on the GALS locomotor screen \\n(Gait, Arms, Legs, Spine). 1\\nEssence ‘Look, feel, and move’ (active and passive). If a joint looks normal  to you, \\nfeels normal  to the patient, and has full range of movement , it usu ally is normal. \\nMake sure the patient is comfortable, and obtain their consent before examination. \\nThe GALS screening examination should be done in light underwear.\\nSpine: Observe from behind:  is muscle bulk normal (buttocks, shoulders)? Is the \\nspine straight? Are paraspinal muscles symmetrical? Any swellings/deformities? \\nObserve from the side:  is cervical and lumbar lordosis normal? Any kyphosis?  \\n‘Touch your toes, please’: is lumbar spine ﬂ exion normal, eg Schober’s test?1 Observe \\nfrom in front:  ‘Tilt your head ’ (without moving the shoulders) —tests lateral neck \\nﬂ exion. Palpate for typical ﬁ bromyalgia tender points (see p558).\\nArms: ‘Try putting your hands behind your head ’—tests functional shoulder move-\\nment. ‘Arms out straight ’—tests elbow extension and forearm supination/prona-\\ntion. Examine the hands: any deformity ( ﬁ g 12.2), wasting, or swellings? Squeeze \\nacross 2nd–5th metacarpophalangeal joints. Pain may denote joint or tendon syno-\\nvitis. ‘Put your index ﬁ  nger on your thumb’—tests pincer grip. Assess dexterity, eg \\nfastening a button or picking up a coin.\\nLegs: Observe legs: normal quadriceps bulk? Any swelling or deformity? With pa-\\ntient lying supine: any leg length discrepancy? Internally/externally rotate each hip \\nin ﬂ exion. Passively ﬂ ex knee and hip to the full extent. Is movement limited? Any \\ncrepitus? Find any knee effusion  using the patella tap test. If there is ﬂ uid, consider \\naspirating and testing for crystals or infection. With patient standing: observe feet: \\nany deformity? Are arches high or ﬂ at? Any callosities? These may indicate an ab-\\nnormal gait of some chronicity. Squeeze across metatarsophalangeal joints: see as \\nfor arms. Also: although not in the GALS system, palpate the heel and Achilles tendon \\nto identify plantar fasciitis and Achilles tendonitis often associated with seronega-\\ntive rheumatological conditions. Examine the patient’s shoes for signs of uneven wear.\\nGait: Observe walking: is the gait smooth? Good arm swing? Stride length OK? Nor-\\nmal heel strike and toe off ? Can they turn quickly?\\nRange of joint movement Is noted in degrees, with anatomical position being the \\nneutral position—eg elbow ﬂ exion 0°–150° normally, but with ﬁ xed ﬂ exion and lim-\\nited movement, range may be reduced to 30°–90°. A valgus deformity deviates later-\\nally (away from the mid-line, ﬁ g 12.3); a varus deformity points towards the mid-line.\\nFig 12.3 Bilateral hallux valgus.\\nReproduced from British Medical Journal , ‘Hallux valgus’, \\nR Choa, R Sharp, K R Mahtani, 2010, with permission from \\nBMJ Publishing Group Ltd.\\n1 Schober’s test: make a mark on the lumbar spine at the level of the posterior iliac spine.

Worse with prolonged activity. Joints may \\n‘gel’ (brief stiff  ness after rest, usually \\n10–15 minutes or so). Joints may feel unstable, \\nwith a perceived lack of power due to pain. Generalized disease: ‘Nodal OA’ (typi-\\ncally DIP, PIP, CMC joints, and knees in post-menopausal females). There may be joint \\ntenderness, derangement and bony swelling (Heberden’s at DIP and Bouchard’s at \\nPIP), reduced range of movement and mild synovitis.

It increases the risk of cardiovascular disease by \\n2–3 fold. Epidemiology Prevalence is ~1% (\\ue000 in smokers). \\ue033:\\ue032 >2:1. Peak onset: 5th–\\n6th decade. HLA DR4/DR1 linked (associated with \\ue000severity).\\nPresentation T ypically: Symmetrical swollen, painful, and stiff  small joints of hands \\nand feet, worse in the morning. This can ﬂ  uctuate and larger joints may become in-\\nvolved. Less common presentations: •Sudden onset, widespread arthritis. •Recur-\\nring mono/\\npolyarthritis of various joints (palindromic RA).2 •Persistent monoarthritis \\n(knee, shoulder, or hip). •Systemic illness with extra-articular symptoms, eg fa tigue, \\nf\\never, weight loss, pericarditis, and pleurisy, but initially few joint problems (com-\\nmoner in \\ue032). •Polymyalgic onset—vague limb girdle aches. •Recurrent soft tissue \\npr\\noblems (eg frozen shoulder, carpal tunnel syndrome, de Quervain’s tenosynovitis).\\nSigns Early: (Inﬂ ammation, no joint damage.) Swollen MCP, PIP, wrist, or MTP joints \\n(often symmetrical). Look for tenosynovitis or bursitis. Later: (Joint damage, de-\\nf\\normity.) Ulnar deviation and subluxation of the wrist and ﬁ ngers. Boutonnière and \\nswan-neck deformities of ﬁ ngers (ﬁ g 12.2 on p540) or Z-deformity of thumbs occur. \\nHand extensor tendons may rupture. Foot changes are similar.

Other common joints are the ankle, foot, small joints of the hand, \\nwrist, elbow, or knee. It can be polyarticular. It is caused by deposition of mono-\\nsodium urate crystals in and near joints. Attacks may be precipitated by trauma, \\nsurgery, starvation, infection, or diuretics. It is associated with raised plasma urate. \\nIn the long term, urate deposits (\\n= tophi, eg in pinna, tendons, joints; see ﬁ g 12.9) and \\nrenal disease (stones, interstitial nephritis) may occur. Prevalence: ~1%. \\ue032 : \\ue033 ≈ 4 : 1.\\nDiff er ential diagnoses Exclude septic arthritis in any acute monoarthropathy \\n(p544). Then consider reactive arthritis, haemarthrosis, CPPD (see following topic) and \\npalindromic RA (p546).\\nRisk factors Reduced urate excretion: Elderly, men, post-menopausal females, \\nimpair\\ned renal function, hypertension, metabolic syndrome, diuretics, antihyper-\\ntensives, aspirin. Excess urate production: Dietary (alcohol, sweeteners, red meat, \\nseaf\\nood), genetic disorders, myelo- and lymphoproliferative disorders, psoriasis, \\ntumour-lysis syndrome, drugs (eg alcohol, warfarin, cytotoxics). Associations: Car-\\ndio\\nvascular disease, hypertension, diabetes mellitus, and chronic renal failure (see \\np680).31 Gout is an independent risk factor for mortality from cardiovascular and \\nrenal disease. Screen for and treat CKD, hypertension, dyslipidaemia, diabetes.\\nInvestigations Polarized light microscopy of synovial ﬂ  uid shows negatively bi-\\nrefringent urate crystals (ﬁ g 12.10). Serum urate (SUA) is usually raised but may be \\nnormal.32 Radiographs show only soft-tissue swelling in the early stages. Later, well-\\ndeﬁ ned ‘punched out’ erosions are seen in juxta-articular bone (see ﬁ g 12.6 on p541). \\nThere is no sclerotic reaction, and joint spaces are preserved until late.\\nTreatment of acute gout High-dose NSAID (see BOX, p545) or if CI use colchicine \\n(500mcg BD) which is eff ective but slower to work (BNF states max 6mg per course \\nalthough rheumatologists will often use more).33 NB: in renal impairment, NSAIDS and \\ncolchicine are problematic. Steroids (oral, IM, or intra-articular) may also be used.34 \\nRest and elevate joint. Ice packs and ‘bed cages’ can be eff ective.\\nPrevention Lose weight, avoid prolonged fasts, alcohol excess, purine-rich meats, \\nand lo\\nw-dose aspirin. Prophylaxis: Start if >1 attack in 12 months, tophi, or renal \\nstones. The aim is to \\ue001 attacks and prevent damage caused by crystal deposition. Use \\nallopurinol and titrate from 100mg/24h, increasing every 4 weeks until plasma urate \\n<0.3mmol/L (max 300mg/8h). SE: rash, fever, \\ue001WCC. Allopurinol may trigger an attack \\nso wait 3 weeks after an acute episode, and cover with regular NSAID (for up to 6 \\nweeks) or colchicine (0.5mg/12h PO for up to 6 months). Avoid stopping allopurinol in \\nacute attacks once established. Febuxostat (80mg/24h) is an alternative if allopuri-\\nnol is CI or not tolerated.

Prevalence: 0.25–1%. Men present earlier:  \\ue032:\\ue033 ~6:1 at 16yrs old, and \\n~2:1 at 30yrs old. ~ 90% are HLA B27 +ve (see BOX). Symptoms and signs:  The \\nt\\nypical patient is a man <30yrs old with gradual onset of low back pain,  worse \\nduring the night with spinal morning stiff  ness relieved by exercise. Pain radi-\\nates from sacroiliac joints to hips/buttocks, and usually improves towards the \\nend of the day. There is progressive loss of spinal movement (all directions)\\n—\\nhence \\ue001thoracic expansion. See pp540–2 for tests of spine ﬂ exion and sacroiliitis. \\nThe disease course is variable; a few progress to kyphosis, neck hyperextension \\n(question-mark posture; ﬁ g \\n12.13), and spino-cranial ankylosis. Other features \\ninclude enthesitis (see BOX), especially Achilles tendonitis, plantar fasciitis, at the \\ntibial and ischial tuberosities, and at the iliac crests. Anterior mechanical chest \\npain due to costochondritis and fatigue may feature. Acute iritis occurs in ~⅓ \\nof patients and may lead to blindness if untreated (but may also have occurred \\nmany years before, so enquire directly). \\nAS is also associated with osteoporosis \\n(up to 60%), aortic valve incompetence ( <3%), and pulmonary apical ﬁ brosis.\\nTests: Diagnosis is clinical, supported by imaging.4 MRI allows detection of active \\ninﬂ ammation (bone marrow oedema) as well as destructive changes such as \\nerosions, sclerosis, and ankylosis.

Autoantibodies are made against a vari-\\nety of autoantigens (eg ANA) which form immune complexes . Inadequate clearance \\nof immune complexes results in a host of immune responses which cause tissue \\ninﬂ ammation and damage. Environmental triggers play a part (eg EBV p405).43 \\nPrevalence ~0.2%. \\ue033:\\ue032≈9:1, typically women of child-bearing age. Commoner in \\nAfrican-Caribbeans, Asians, and if HLA B8, DR2, or DR3 +ve. ~10% of patients have a \\n1st- or 2nd-degree relative with SLE.\\nClinical features See BOX. Remitting and relapsing illness of variable presentation \\nand course. Features often non-speciﬁ c (malaise, fatigue, myalgia, and fever) or or-\\ngan-speciﬁ c and caused by active inﬂ ammation or damage. Other features include \\nlymphadenopathy, weight loss, alopecia, nail-fold infarcts, non-infective endocarditis \\n(Libman–Sacks syndrome), Raynaud’s (30%; see p708), stroke, and retinal exudates.\\nImmunology >95% are ANA +ve. A high anti-double-stranded DNA (dsDNA) antibody \\ntitre is highly speciﬁ  c, but only +ve in ~60% of cases. ENA (p553) may be +ve in 20–30% \\n(anti-Ro, anti-La, anti-Sm, anti-RNP); 40% are RhF +ve; antiphospholipid antibodies (an-\\nticardiolipin or lupus anticoagulant) may also be +ve. SLE may be associated with other \\nautoimmune conditions: Sjögren’s (15–20%), autoimmune thyroid disease (5–10%).\\nDiagnosis See BOX. Monitoring activity Three best tests: 1 Anti-dsDNA antibody ti-\\ntres. 2 Complement: \\ue001C3, \\ue001C4 (denotes consumption of complement, hence \\ue001C3 and \\ue001C4, \\nand \\ue000C3d and \\ue000C4d, their degradation products). 3 ESR. Also: BP, urine for casts or pro-\\ntein (lupus nephritis, below), FBC, U&E, LFTs, CRP (usually normal) \\ue007think of SLE when-\\never someone has a multisystem disorder and \\ue000ESR but CRP normal. If \\ue000 CRP, think \\ninstead of infection, serositis, or arthritis. Skin or renal biopsies may be diagnostic.\\nDrug-induced lupus Causes (>80 drugs) include isoniazid, hydralazine (if >50mg/24h \\nin slow acetylators), procainamide, quinidine, chlorpromazine, minocycline, phenyto-\\nin, anti-\\nTNF agents. It is associated with antihistone antibodies in >95% of cases. Skin \\nand lung signs prevail (renal and CNS are rarely aff ected). The disease remits if the \\ndrug is stopped. Sulfonamides or the oral contraceptive pill may worsen idiopathic SLE.\\nManagement Refer: complex cases should involve specialist SLE/nephritis clinics.\\n  • Gener al measures: High-factor sunblock. Hydroxychloroquine, unless contraindi-\\ncat\\ned, reduces disease activity and improves survival. Screen for co-morbidities \\nand medication toxicity. For skin ﬂ ares, ﬁ rst trial topical steroids.\\n  • Maint enance: NSAIDs (unless renal disease) and hydroxychloroquine for joint and \\nskin symptoms. Azathioprine, methotrexate, and mycophenolate as steroid-spar-\\ning agents. Belimumab (monoclonal antibody) used as an add-on therapy for auto-\\nantibody positiv\\ne disease where disease activity is high.44 (See BOX.)\\n  • Mild ﬂ ar es: (No serious organ damage.) Hydroxychloroquine or low-dose steroids.\\n  • Moder ate ﬂ  ares: (Organ involvement.) May require DMARDs or mycophenolate.\\n\\ue007\\ue007Se vere ﬂ  ares: I f life- or organ-threatening,  eg haemolytic anaemia, nephritis, \\nsevere pericarditis or CNS disease; urgent high-dose steroids, mycophenolate, rituxi-\\nmab, cyclophosphamide. MDT working vital for neuropsychiatric lupus (psychometric \\ntesting, lumbar puncture may be indicated).\\nLupus nephritis: (p 314.) May require more intensive immunosuppression with ster-\\noids and cyclophosphamide or mycophenolate. BP control vital (e.g. ACE-i). Renal re-\\nplacement therapy (p306) may be needed if disease progresses; nephritis recurs in \\n~50% post-transplant, but is a rare cause of graft failure.45\\nPrognosis: ~80% survival at 15 years.43 There is an increased long-term risk of CVD \\nand osteoporosis.\\nAntiphospholipid syndrome Can be associated with SLE (20–30%). Often occurs \\nas a primary disease. Antiphospholipid antibodies  (anticardiolipin & lupus antico-\\nagulant, anti-\\ue020 2 glycoprotein 1) cause CLOTS: Coagulation defect (arterial/venous), \\nLivedo reticularis (p 557), Obstetric (recurrent miscarriage), Thrombocytopenia. \\nT\\nhrombotic tendency aff  ects cerebral, renal, and other vessels.

Their exist-\\nence as discrete entities is controversial, especially in the absence of clear pathol-\\nogy, and some ﬁ nd such dysfunctional diagnoses frustrating. H owever, a correct \\ndiagnosis enables the doctor to give appropriate counselling and advise appropriate \\ntherapies, and allows the patient to begin to accept and deal with their symptoms.\\nFibromyalgia\\nFibromyalgia comprises up to \\n10% of new referrals to the rheumatology clinic.54\\nPrevalence: 0.5–4%. \\ue033:\\ue032≈6:1 but varies depending on which diagnostic criteria are \\nused .\\nRisk factors: BOX ‘Risk factors’. Female sex, middle age, low household income, di-\\nvorced, low educational status.\\nAssociations: Other somatic syndromes such as chronic fatigue syndrome, irritable \\nbo\\nwel syndrome (p 266), and chronic headaches syndromes (see OHCS p502). Also \\nfound in ~25% of patients with RA, AS, and SLE.\\nFeatures: Diagnosis depends on pain that is chr onic (>3 months) and widespread \\n(involves left and right sides, above and below the waist, and the axial skeleton). \\nProfound fatigue is almost universal with complaint of unrefreshing sleep and \\nsigniﬁ cant fatigue and pain with small increases in physical exertion. Additional \\nfeatures: morning stiff ness (~\\n80–90%), paraesthesiae (without underlying cause), \\nheadaches (migraine and tension), poor concentration, low mood, and sleep distur-\\nbance (~\\n70%). Widespread and severe tender points.\\nInvestigations: All normal. Diagnosis is clinical. Over-investigation can consolidate \\nillness beha\\nviour; but exclude other causes of pain and/or fatigue (eg RA, PMR see \\np557, vasculitis see p556, hypothyroidism see p220, myeloma see p368).\\nManagement: Multidisciplinary with optimal results coming from full engagement \\no\\nf the patient who should be encouraged to remain as active as they feel able, and \\nideally to continue to participate in the workforce. New symptoms should be fully \\nreviewed to exclude an alternative diagnosis. Patients should be advised that there \\nis no one speciﬁ c treatment that is guaranteed to work, but any of the following may \\nhelp: graded exercise programmes, including both aerobic and strength-based train-\\ning. Pacing of activity is vital to avoid over-exertion and consequent pain and fatigue. \\nLong-term graded exercise programmes  improve functional capacity.\\n55, 56 Relaxa-\\ntion, rehabilitation and physiotherapy may also help. Cognitive-behavioural therapy \\n(CBT) aims to help patients develop coping strategies and set achievable goals.57\\nPharmacotherapy: Low-dose amitriptyline (eg 10–20mg at night) has been shown \\nto help relieve pain and improve sleep. Pregabalin (150–300mg/12h PO) can be used if \\namitriptyline is ineff  ective. Duloxetine or an SSRI can be used for ﬁ bromyalgia with \\ncomorbid anxiety and depression.

Such a diagnosis may be a relief or a \\ndisappointment to the patient. Explain that ﬁ bromyalgia is a relapsing and re-\\nmitting condition, with no easy cures, and that they will continue to have good \\nand bad days. Reassure them that there is no serious underlying pathology, that \\ntheir joints are not being damaged, and that no further tests are necessary, but \\nbe sympathetic to the fact that they may have been seeking a physical cause for \\ntheir symptoms.\\nWe all at some stage come across a patient with diffi   cult symptoms and an \\nexasperating lack of pathology to explain them. Investigations are all normal, \\nand medications do not seem to work. It is tempting to dismiss such patients as \\nmalingerers, but often this conclusion comes from the clinician approaching the \\nproblem from the wrong angle. The patient has symptoms that are real and disa-\\nbling to them, and that will not improve without help. Perhaps a more pragmatic \\napproach is to take advice from the Danish philosopher Kierkegaard who wrote to \\na friend in \\n1835, ‘What I really lack is to be clear in my mind what I am to do, not \\nwhat I am to know ... The thing is to understand myself ... to ﬁ  nd a truth which is \\ntrue for me.’ Listen to the patient and accept their story. Then help them to focus \\non what they can do to improve their situation, and to move away from dwelling \\non ﬁ  nding a physical answer to their symptoms.\\nAn existential approach to diffi  cult symptoms\\nPsychosocial risk factors for developing persisting chronic pain and long-term \\ndisability have been termed ‘yellow ﬂ ags’: \\n59\\n\\ue007Belief that pain and activity are harmful.\\n\\ue007Sickness behaviours such as extended rest.\\n\\ue007Social withdrawal.\\n\\ue007Emotional problems such as low mood, anxiety, or stress.\\n\\ue007Problems or dissatisfaction at work.\\n\\ue007Problems with claims for compensation or time off  work.\\n\\ue007Overprotective family or lack of support.\\n\\ue007Inappropriate expectations of treatment, eg low active participation in treatment.\\nRisk factors: yellow ﬂ ags\\nThe current hypothesis is that ﬁ  bromyalgia is caused by aberrant peripheral and \\ncentral pain processing. Two key features of the condition are allodynia (pain in re-\\nsponse to a non-painful stimulus) and hyperaesthesia  (exaggerated perception of \\npain in response to a mildly painful stimulus), examined for by palpation of tender \\npoints. Research is beginning to suggest that certain antidepressants can relieve \\npain and other symptoms, and especially those that have both serotonergic and \\nnoradrenergic activity (tricyclics and venlafaxine). Those acting on serotonergic \\nreceptors only are less eff  ective. There is also some evidence to support the use \\nof alternative therapies such as acupuncture and spa therapies, which have been \\npostulated to act through similar spinal pain-modulatory pathways.\\n60 Thus far, \\ntrials have involved relatively small numbers of patients or short time periods, \\nand lack the power to draw strong conclusions. However, it is interesting to note \\nthat the \\nCSF of patients with ﬁ bromyalgia appears to have increased levels of sub-\\nstance P, while levels of noradrenaline and serotonin metabolites are decreased. \\nAll three are neurotransmitters involved in descending pain-modulatory pathways \\nin the spinal cord.\\n61, 62 Evidence from PET imaging suggests that patients with ﬁ bro-\\nmyalgia may have an abnormal central dopamine response to pain.63 The critical \\nquestion is: is this cause or eff ect?\\nPathogenesis of ﬁ bromyalgia\\n_OHCM_10e.indb   559_OHCM_10e.indb   559 02/05/2017   19:0802/05/2017   19:08'),\n",

In fact, written consent itself is not required by \\nlaw, but it does constitute ‘good medical practice’ in the best interests of the patient \\nand practitioner. Sometimes actions and words can imply valid consent, eg by simply \\nentering into conversation or holding out an arm. If the consequences are not clear \\nand the patient has capacity to give consent, you should seek informed written \\nconsent as a record of your conversation.\\nFor consent to be valid\\n  • It can be given any time before the intervention/treatment is initiated. Earlier is \\nbett\\ner as this will give the patient time to think about the risks, beneﬁ ts, and al-\\nternatives—he or she may even bring forward questions on issues that you had \\nnot considered relevant. Think of consent as an ongoing process throughout the \\npatient’s time with you, not just the moment of signing the form.\\n  • The proposed treatment or test must be clearly understood by the patient, taking \\nint\\no account the beneﬁ  ts, risks (including complication rates if known), additional \\nprocedures, alternative courses of action, and their consequences.\\n  • It must be given v oluntarily. This can be diffi  cult to evaluate—eg when live organ \\ndonation is being considered—see BOX ‘Special circumstances for consent’ for other \\ndiffi  cult situations.\\n  • The doctor providing treatment or undertaking the test needs to ensure that the \\npatient has giv\\nen valid consent. The act of seeking consent is ultimately the respon-\\nsibility of the doctor looking after the patient, though the task may be delegated \\nto another health professional, as long as they are suitably trained and qualiﬁ ed.\\nCapacity relates to the ability to \\n1 understand, 2 retain, and 3 weigh up relevant \\ninformation and 4 communicate the decision. Capacity is not a ﬁ  xed state, but is \\nspeciﬁ c to any given time and decision—a person may lack capacity to be involved \\nin a particular complex decision but retain capacity to decide other aspects of their \\ncare, or recover capacity as they recover from acute illness. Therefore, do not label \\nanyone as unable to make a decision unless you have taken all practicable steps to \\nhelp them to do so without success\\n—non-urgent decisions should always be deferred \\nif there is a chance to recover capacity. When acting on behalf of a person who lacks \\ncapacity, do so in their best interests and involve family members or an appointed \\nsurrogate where clinical urgency allows.\\nWhen taking consent\\n  • Does the patient currently have capacity for the decision in question?\\n  • Are you the right person to be obtaining consent?\\n2\\n  • Use words the patient understands and avoid jargon and abbreviations.\\n  • Ensure that they believe your facts and can retain ‘pros’ and ‘cons’ long enough to \\ninf\\norm their decision. Fact sheets/diagrams for individual operations help.\\n  • Make sure their choice is free from pressure from others, and explain that they can \\nwithdr\\naw consent at any time after the form is signed. Some patients may view the \\nconsent form as a contract from which they cannot renege.\\n  • If the patient is illiterate, a witnessed mark does endorse valid consent. Similarly, \\nif the patient is willing but ph\\nysically unable to sign the consent form, then a wit-\\nnessed entry into the medical notes stating so is valid.\\n  • Remember to discuss further procedures that may become necessary during the \\npr\\noposed treatment. This avoids waking up to a nasty surprise (eg a missing testi-\\ncle as in scenario 5 earlier in this topic).\\n_OHCM_10e.indb   568_OHCM_10e.indb   568 02/05/2017   19:0802/05/2017   19:08'),\n",

No single suture ﬁ  ts the bill for every \\noccasion, and so suture selection (including size) depends on the job in hand (see \\ntables 13.2, 13.3). In their broadest sense they are absorbable or non-absorbable, \\nsynthetic or natural, and their structure may be divided into monoﬁ lament, twisted, \\nor braided. Monoﬁ  lament sutures are quite slippery but minimize infection and pro-\\nduce less reaction. Braided sutures have plaited strands and provide secure knots, \\nbut they may allow infection to occur in surrounding tissue between their strands. \\nTwisted sutures have \\n2 twisted strands and similar qualities to braided sutures. Sizes \\nare denoted according to a scale running down from #5 (heavy braided suture). Most \\ncommon modern sutures are smaller than size # 0, hence rising numbers with a - 0 \\nsuffi  x correspond to progressively ﬁ  ner grades of suture up to 11–0 (ﬁ ne ophthalmic \\nmonoﬁ laments). 3–0 or 4–0 are the best sizes for skin closure. Timing of suture re-\\nmoval depends on site and the general health of the patient. Face and neck sutures \\nmay be removed after \\n5d (earlier in children), scalp and back of neck after 5d, ab-\\ndominal incisions and proximal limbs (including clips) after ~10d, distal extremities \\nafter 14d. In patients with poor wound healing, eg steroids, malignancy, infection, \\ncachexia (p35), the elderly, or smokers, sutures may need ~14d.\\nAbsorbable\\nTable 13.2 Absorbable suture materials\\nName Material Construction Use\\nMonocryl® Poliglecaprone Monoﬁ  lament Subcuticular skin closure\\nPDS® Polydioxanone Monoﬁ  lament Closing abdominal wall\\nVicryl® Polyglactin Braided multiﬁ  lament Tying pedicles; bowel \\nanasto mosis; subcutaneous \\nclosure\\nDexon® Polyglycolic acid Braided multiﬁ  lament Very similar to Vicryl®\\nNon-absorbable\\nT\\nable 13.3 Non-absorbable suture materials\\nName Material Construction Use\\nEthilon® Polyamide Monoﬁ  lament Closing skin wounds\\nProlene® Polypropylene Monoﬁ  lament Arterial anastomosis\\nMersilk®N Silk Braided multiﬁ lament Securing drains\\nMetal Eg steel Clips or monoﬁ  lament Skin wound/sternotomy closure\\nN = natural; other natural materials (eg cotton and catgut) are rarely used these days.\\nSome commonly encountered suture materials\\nThe decision when to insert and remove drains may seem to be one of the great \\nsurgical enigmas—but there are basically three types to get a grip of:\\n1       To drain the area of surgery and are often put under suction or Ωve pressure \\n(Redivac® uses a ‘high vacuum’).

Explain that they \\nmay feel ill on waking. The premedication aims to allay anxiety and to make the \\nanaesthesia itself easier to conduct (see \\nBOX). Typical regimens might include:\\n  • Anxioly tics: Benzodiazepines, eg lorazepam 2mg PO; temazepam 10–20mg PO. In \\nchildren, use oral premeds as ﬁ rst choice, eg midazolam 0.5mg/kg (tastes bitter so \\noften put in paracetamol suspension). Give oral premedication 2h before surgery \\n(1h if IM route used).\\n  • Analgesics: See p574. Pre-emptive analgesia is not often used and eff  ects are hard \\nto determine. The aim is to dampen pain signals before they arrive. In children or \\nanxious adults, local anaesthetic cream may be used on a few sites before inserting \\nan \\nIVI (\\ue007the anaesthetist may prefer to site the cannula themselves!).\\n  • Anti-eme tics: Post-operative nausea and vomiting is experienced by ~25% of \\nall patients. 5HT3 antagonists (eg ondansetron 4mg IV/IM) are the most eff ective \\nagents; others, eg metoclopramide 10mg/8h IV/IM/PO, are also used—see p251.\\n  • Ant acids: Ranitidine 50mg IV or omeprazole 40mg PO/IV if aspiration risk.\\n  • Antisialogues: Glycopyrronium ( 200–400mcg in adults, 4–8mcg/kg in children; \\ngiven IV/IM 30–60min before induction) is sometimes used to decrease secretions \\nthat may cause respiratory obstruction in smaller airways.\\n  • Antibio tics: See p 570.\\nSide-eff ects of anaesthetic agents\\n  • Hyoscine, atropine:  Anticholinergic, \\ue018 tach ycardia, urinary retention, glaucoma, \\nsedation (especially in the elderly).\\n  • Opioids: Respiratory depression, \\ue001cough r eﬂ ex, nausea and vomiting, constipation.\\n  • T hiopental: (Induction agent.)

Respiratory/cardiac depression, pain on injection.\\n  • V\\nolatile agents, eg isoﬂ  urane: Nausea and vomiting, cardiac depression, respira-\\ntory depression, vasodilation, hepatotoxicity (see BNF).\\nThe complications of anaesthesia are due to loss of:\\n  • P\\nain sensation:  Urinary retention, pressure necrosis, local nerve injuries (eg radial \\nnerv\\ne palsy from arm hanging over the table edge).\\n  • Consciousness:  Cannot communicate ‘wrong leg/kidney’. NB: in some patients (eg \\n0.15%) retained consciousness is the problem. Awareness under GA sounds like a \\ncontradiction of terms, but remember that anaesthesia is a process rather than an \\nevent. Such awareness can lead to ill-deﬁ ned, delayed neuroses and post-traumatic \\nstress disorder (OHCS p353).\\n  • Muscle po wer: Corneal abrasion (\\ue018 tape the e yes closed), no respiration, no cough \\n(leads to pneumonia and atelectasis—partial lung collapse causing shunting ± im-\\npaired gas exchange: it starts minutes after induction, and may be related to the \\nuse of \\n100% O2, supine position, surgery, age, and to loss of power).\\nLocal/regional anaesthesia If unﬁ t/unwilling to undergo general anaesthesia, lo-\\ncal nerve blocks (eg brachial plexus) or spinal blocks (contraindication: anticoagula-\\ntion, local infection) using long-acting local anaesthetics such as bupivacaine may be \\nindicated.

If we can connect with patients’ in ner lives \\nwe may make a real diff erence. Never forget how painful pain is, nor how fear mag-\\nniﬁ es pain. Try not to let these sensations, so often interposed between your patient \\nand recovery, be invisible to you as he or she bravely puts up with them.\\nApproach to management (ﬁ g 13.5 and p532.) Review and chart each pain carefully \\nand individually.\\n  • Identify and treat the underlying pathology wherever possible.\\n  • Give r egular doses rather than on an ‘as-required’ basis.\\n  • Choose the best route: PO, PR, IM, epidural, SC, inhalation, or IV.\\n  • Explanation and reassurance contribute greatly to analgesia.\\n  • Allow the patient to be in charge. This promotes wellbeing, and does not lead to \\no\\nveruse. Patient-controlled continuous IV morphine delivery systems are useful.\\n  • Liaise with the Acute Pain Service, if possible.\\nNon-narcotic (simple) analgesia Paracetamol 0.5–1.0g/4h PO (up to 4g daily; 15mg/\\nkg/4h IV over 15min in children <50kg; up to 60mg/kg/d). Caution in liver impair-\\nment. NSAIDS, eg ibuprofen 400mg/8h PO (see BNFC for dosing in children) are good \\nfor musculoskeletal pain and renal or biliary colic. CI: peptic ulcer, clotting disorders, \\nanticoagulants. Cautions: asthma, renal or hepatic impairment, heart failure, IHD, \\npregnancy, and the elderly. Aspirin is contraindicated in children due to the risk of \\nReye’s syndrome (\\nOHCS p652).\\nOpioid drugs for severe pain Morphine (eg 10–15mg/2–4h IV/IM) or diamor phine \\n(5–10mg/2–4h PO, SC, or slow IV, but you may need much more) are best.  NB: these \\nare ‘controlled’ drugs. For palliative care, see p 532. Alternative delivery routes in-\\nclude transdermal (once baseline requirements are established) or sublingual. \\nSide-effects of opioids:  These include nausea (so give with an anti-emetic, p 251), \\nrespiratory depression, constipation, cough suppression, urinary retention, \\ue001BP, and \\nsedation (do not use in hepatic failure or head injury). Dependency is rarely a prob-\\nlem. Naloxone (eg \\n100–200mcg IV, followed by 100mcg increments, eg every 2min \\nuntil responsive) may be needed to reverse the eff  ects of excess opioids (p842).\\nEpidural analgesia Opioids and anaesthetics are given into the epidural space by \\ninfusion or as boluses. A\\nsk the advice of the Pain Service. SES are thought to be less, \\nas the drug is more localized: watch for respiratory depression and local anaesthetic-\\ninduced autonomic blockade (\\ue001\\nBP).\\nAdjuvant treatments Eg radiotherapy for bone cancer pain; anticonvulsants, an-\\ntidepr\\nessants, gabapentin or steroids for neuropathic pain, antispasmodics, eg hy-\\noscine butylbromide4 (Buscopan® 10–20mg/8h PO/IM/IV) for intestinal or renal tract \\ncolic. If brief pain relief is needed (eg for changing dressings or exploring wounds), \\ntry inhaled nitrous oxide (with \\n50% O2—as Entonox®) with an ‘on-demand’ valve. \\nTranscutaneous electrical nerve stimulation (TENS), local heat, local or regional an-\\naesthesia, and neurosurgical procedures (eg excision of neuroma) may be tried but \\ncan prove disappointing.

The skill and persistence required to gently and atraumatically tease \\napart these ﬁ brous bands that restrict access and vision makes any progression, \\nno matter how slight, cause for subdued celebration. Perseverance is the name \\nof this game.\\nSurgical division of adhesions is known as adhesiolysis. Any surgical procedure \\nthat br\\neaches the abdominal or pelvic cavities can predispose to the formation \\nof adhesions, which are found in up to 90% of those with previous abdominal \\nsurgery; this is why we do not rush to operate on small bowel obstruction: the op-\\neration predisposes to yet more adhesions. Handling of the serosal surface of the \\nbowel causes inﬂ ammation, which over weeks to years can lead to the formation \\nof ﬁ brous bands that tether the bowel to itself or adjacent structures\\n—though \\nadhesions can also form secondary to infection, radiation injury, and inﬂ ammatory \\nprocesses such as Crohn’s disease. Their main sequelae are intestinal obstruction \\n(the cause in ~\\n60% of cases—see p610) and chronic abdominal or pelvic pain. Stud-\\nies have shown that adhesiolysis may help relieve chronic pain, though for a small \\nproportion of patients the pain never improves or even worsens after directed \\nintervention.\\nAs far as prevention is concerned, the best approach is to avoid operating; lapa-\\nroscopy compared with laparotomy reduces the rate of local adhesions. Insertion \\nof synthetic ﬁ lms (eg hyaluronic acid/carboxymethyl membrane) to prevent adhe-\\nsions to the anterior abdominal wall reduces incidence, extent, and severity of \\nadhesions, but not incidence of obstruction or operative re-intervention.\\nAdhesions—legacy of the laparotomy, bane of the surgeon\\n_OHCM_10e.indb   581_OHCM_10e.indb   581 02/05/2017   19:0802/05/2017   19:08'),\n",

NB: a stoma can \\nalso be made between two internal conduits (eg a choledochojejunostomy).\\nColostomies (Usually left illiac fossa and ﬂ  ush with the skin—ﬁ g 13.8.) May be tem-\\nporary or permanent. Are they suitable for a laparoscopic operation?\\n  • L oop colostomy: A loop of colon is exteriorized and partially divided, forming two \\nst\\nomas that are joined together (the proximal end passes stool, the distal end passes \\nmucus, see ﬁ g 13.6). A rod under the loop prevents retraction and may be removed \\nafter 7d. A loop colostomy is often temporary and performed to protect a distal \\nanastomosis, eg after anterior resection.\\n  • End colos tomy: The bowel is divided and the proximal end brought out as a stoma; \\nthe d\\nistal end may be: 1 resected, eg abdominoperineal (AP) resection (inspect the \\nperineum for absent anus when examining a stoma) 2 closed and left in the abdo-\\nmen (Hartmann’s procedure) 3 exteriorized, forming a ‘mucous ﬁ stula’.\\n  • P aul –Mikulicz colostomy:  A double-barrelled colostomy in which the colon is di-\\nvided complet\\nely (eg to excise a section of bowel). Each end is exteriorized as two \\nseparate stomas.\\nOutput: Colostomies ideally pass 1–2 formed motions/day into an adherent plastic \\npouch. Some may be managed with irrigation, thus avoiding a pouch.\\nIncidence: 21 000 stomas/yr in UK (>50% are permanent). Most manage their stomas \\nwell. The cost for appliances is ~£1500/yr. If there is a skin reaction to the adhesive \\nor pouch, a change of device may be all that is needed. Contact the stoma nurse.\\nIleostomies (Usually right illiac fossa.) Protrude from the skin and emit frequent \\nﬂ \\nuid motions which contain active enzymes (so the skin needs protecting —see ﬁ g \\n13.7). Loop ileostomies can be formed to defunction the colon as a temporary meas-\\nure eg during control of diffi   cult perianal Crohn’s disease. End ileostomy follows total \\nor subtotal  colectomy, eg for UC; subsequent formation of ileal pouch-anal anasto-\\nmosis (pouch of ileum is joined to the upper anal canal) can allow for stoma reversal.\\nAlternative (non-stoma forming) surgery Low/ultralow anterior resection: All \\nor part o\\nf the rectum is excised and the proximal colon anastomosed to the top of the \\nanal canal (the lower the level of anastomosis, the higher the risk of complication). \\nTransanal endoscopic microsurgery:  Allows excision of small tumours within the \\nr\\nectum with preservation of sphincter function.\\nUrostomies are fashioned after total cystectomy, bringing urine from the ureters \\nt\\no the abdominal wall via an ileal conduit that is usually incontinent. Formation of \\na cathet\\nerizable valvular mechanism may retain continence. Advances in urological \\nsurgery have seen an increase in continence-saving procedures such as orthotopic \\nneobladder reconstruction, with good long-term continence rates.\\nWhen choosing a stoma site, avoid:\\n  • Bony prominences (eg anterior superior iliac spine, costal margins).\\n  • The umbilicus.\\n  • Old wounds/scars\\n—there may be adhesions beneath.\\n  • Skin folds and creases.\\n  • The waistline.\\n  • The site should be assessed pre-operatively by the stoma nurse, with the patient \\nbo\\nth lying and standing.\\n_OHCM_10e.indb   582_OHCM_10e.indb   582 02/05/2017   19:0802/05/2017   19:08'),\n",

See \\ntable 13.6.\\nWhy are so many hospital patients malnourished?\\n1\\n      Increased nutritional requirements (eg sepsis, burns, surgery).\\n2       Increased nutritional losses (eg malabsorption, output from stoma).\\n3       Decreased intake (eg dysphagia, nausea, sedation, coma).\\n4       Eff ect of treatment (eg nausea, diarrhoea).\\n5       Enforced starvation (eg prolonged periods nil by mouth).\\n6       Missing meals (eg due to investigations—minimize meal time disruption).\\n7       Diffi  cult y with feeding  (eg lost dentures; no one available to assist).\\n8       Unappetizing food.\\nIdentifying at-risk patients Assess nutrition state (using eg Malnutrition Univer-\\nsal Scr\\neening Tool3) and weight on admission; reassess weekly thereafter. Involve \\ndieticians early in those at risk.\\n  • His tory: Recent \\ue001w eight ( >20%, accounting for ﬂ  uid balance); recent reduced in-\\ntake; diet change (eg recent change in consistency of food); nausea, vomiting, pain, \\ndiarrhoea which might have led to reduced intake.\\n  • E\\nxamination: State of hydration (p 666): dehydration can go hand-in-hand with \\nmalnutrition, and overhydration can mask malnutrition. Evidence of malnutrition: \\nskin hanging off  muscles (eg over biceps); no fat between fold of skin; hair rough \\nand wiry; pressure sores; sores at corner of mouth. Calculate body mass index \\n(p\\n244); BMI <18.5kg/m2 suggests malnour ishment. Anthropomorphic indices, eg \\nmid-arm circumference, skin fold measures, and grip strength are also used.\\n  • In vestigations: Generally unhelpful. Low albumin suggestive, but is aff  ect ed by \\nmany things other than nutrition. \\ue000Albumin can be helpful in monitoring recovery.\\nEnteral nutrition (Ie nutrition given into gastrointestinal tract.) If at all possible, \\ngiv\\ne nutrition by mouth. An all-ﬂ uid diet can meet requirements (but get advice from \\ndietician). If danger of choking or aspiration (eg after stroke), consider semi-solid \\ndiet. Early post-op enteral nutrition has been shown to beneﬁ t patients (eg after \\nGI \\nsurgery) and may reduce complications. Tube feeding: Liquid nutrition via a tube: \\nNasogastric t\\nypically placed without guidance (p759); nasojejunal tubes require en-\\ndoscopic placement (used if gastric outlet obstruction, delayed gastric emptying, \\npost-gastrectomy, or pancreatitis). Alternatively, gastric or jejunal tubes may be in-\\nserted radiologically or surgically (ie gastrostomy/jejunostomy)\\n. Use for nutritionally \\ncomplete, commercially prepared feeds. \\ue007Close liaison with a dietician is essential. \\nP\\nolymeric feeds consist of undigested proteins, starches, and long-chain fatty acids \\n(eg Nutrison standard®, Osmolite®). Normally contain ~1kCal/mL and 4–6g protein \\nper 100mL. Typical requirements met with 2L/24h. Elemental feeds consist of indi-\\nvidual amino acids, oligo- and monosaccharides needing minimal digestion. Feed is \\ntypically initiated at a slow, continuous rate (nausea and vomiting less problematic) \\nbut patients may build up to shorter, bolus feeds, freeing them from pumps between.\\nGuidelines for success\\n  • Use ﬁ ne-bor\\ne ( 9Fr) nasogastric feeding tube when possible.\\n  • Check position of nasogastric tube (pH testing)  bef ore starting feeding (p759); the \\npositioning of a nasojejunal tube can be checked on abdominal X-ray.\\n  • Build up feeds gradually to avoid diarrhoea and distension.\\n  • Weigh at least weekly.\\n  • Check blood glucose and plasma electrolytes (monitor for refeeding syndrome if \\npr\\neviously malnourished—p587).\\n  • Treat underlying conditions vigorously, eg sepsis may impede +ve nitrogen balance. \\n_OHCM_10e.indb   584_OHCM_10e.indb   584 02/05/2017   19:0802/05/2017   19:08'),\n",

Specialist advice is vital. \\nIt should only be considered if the patient is likely to become malnourished with-\\nout it\\n—this normally means that the gastrointestinal tract is not functioning (eg \\nbowel obstruction), and is unlikely to function for at least 7d. Parenteral feeding may \\nsupplement other forms of nutrition (eg in short bowel syndrome or active Crohn’s \\ndisease, when nutrition cannot be suffi   ciently absorbed in the gut) or it can be used \\nalone (total parenteral nutrition\\n—TPN). \\ue007Even if there is GI disease, studies show that \\nenteral nutrition is safer, cheaper, and at least as effi  cacious as parenteral nutrition \\nin the perioperative period.5\\nAdministration Nutrition must be given via a dedicated central venous line (or \\nperipher\\nally inserted central catheter—PICC line) or via a dedicated lumen of a multi-\\nlumen catheter (see ﬁ gs 13.9 and 13.10).\\nRequirements There are many diff  erent regimens for parenteral feeding. Most \\nprovide 2000kCal and 10–14g nitrogen in 2–3L; this usually meets a patient’s daily \\nrequirements (see table 13.6, p585). ~50% of calories are provided by fat and ~50% \\nby carbohydrate. Regimens comprise vitamins, minerals, trace elements, and elec-\\ntrolytes; these will normally be included by the pharmacist.\\nComplications\\n  • Sepsis: (eg St\\naphylococcus epidermidis  and Staphylococcus aureus;  Candida; \\nPseudomonas; infective endocarditis.) Look for spiking pyrexia and examine \\nwound at tube insertion point. Stop \\nPN, take line and peripheral cultures and give \\nantibiotics via the line. If central venous line-related sepsis is suspected, the safest \\ncourse of action is always to remove the line. Do not attempt to salvage a line when \\nStaph. aureus  or Candida infection has been identiﬁ ed.\\n  • T\\nhrombosis: Central vein thrombosis may occur, resulting in pulmonary embolus \\nor superior v\\nena caval obstruction (p528).\\n  • Me tabolic imbalance: Electrolyte abnormalities —see BOX ‘Refeeding syndrome’; \\nderanged plasma glucose; hyperlipidaemia; deﬁ  ciency syndromes (table 6.9, p268); \\nacid-base disturbance (eg hypercapnia from excessive CO2 production).\\n  • Mechanical: Pneumothorax; embolism of IV line tip.\\nGuidelines for success\\n\\ue007Liaise closely with line insertion team, nutrition team, and pharmacist.\\n  • Meticulous sterility. Do not use central venous lines for uses other than nutrition. \\nR\\nemove the line if you suspect infection. Culture its tip.\\n  • Review ﬂ uid balance at least twice daily, and requirements for energy and elec-\\ntrolytes daily.\\n  • Check weight, ﬂ  \\n uid balance, and urine glucose daily during establishment of par-\\nenteral nutrition. Check plasma glucose, creatinine and electrolytes (including cal-\\ncium and phosphate), and \\nFBC daily until stable. Check LFT and lipid clearance three \\ntimes a week until stable. Check zinc and magnesium weekly.\\n  • Do not rush. Achieve the maintenance regimen in small steps.\\n  • Treat underlying conditions vigorously—eg sepsis may impede +ve nitrogen balance.\\n5 Enteral feeding promotes integrity of the gut mucosal barrier, thus preventing bacterial and endotoxin \\ntranslocation across the gut wall, which can lead to multiple organ dysfunction and perpetuation of a sys-\\ntemic inﬂ ammatory response—even when the gut is not the primary source of pathology.\\n_OHCM_10e.indb   586_OHCM_10e.indb   586 02/05/2017   19:0802/05/2017   19:08'),\n",

At-risk patients include those initiating artiﬁ cial \\nfeeding (enteral or parenteral) after prolonged starvation, or with malignancy, \\nanorexia nervosa, or alcoholism. As the body turns to fat and protein metabolism \\nin the starved state, there is a drop in the level of circulating insulin (because of the \\npaucity of dietary carbohydrates). The catabolic state also depletes intracellular \\nstores of phosphate, although serum levels may remain normal (0.85–1.45mmol/L). \\nWhen refeeding begins, the level of insulin rises in response to the carbohydrate \\nload, and one of the consequences is to increase cellular uptake of phosphate.\\nA hypophosphataemic state (<0.50mmol/L) normally develops within 4d and is \\nmostly responsible for the features of ‘refeeding syndrome ’, which include: rhab-\\ndomyolysis; red and white cell dysfunction; respiratory insuffi  ciency; arrhythmias; \\ncardiogenic shock; seizures; sudden death.\\nPrevention Give high-dose Pabrinex ® during re-feeding window.

This group face a greater risk of post-\\noperative infection and cardiac complications. Tight glycaemic control is therefore \\nessential and improves outcome. Aim to achieve an HbA1C of <69mmol/mol prior to \\nelective surgery. Patients are often well informed about their diabetes—involve them \\nfully in managing their diabetic care. Check your hospital’s policy for managing dia-\\nbetic patients who will be \\nNBM before surgery. A general guide follows.\\nInsulin-treated diabetes mellitus\\n  • Try to place the patient ﬁ rst on the list in order to minimize the fasting period.\\n  • Give all usual insulin the night before surgery.\\n  • Long-acting (basal) insulin is usually continued at normal times (eg glargine; de-\\nt\\nemir), even when patients are on a variable rate intravenous insulin infusion (VRIII)—\\npreviously known as a ‘sliding scale’ (see BOX).\\n  • If on AM list, ensure no subcutaneous rapid-acting (bolus) or mixed insulin is given \\non the morning of surgery. If PM list, give the normal morning bolus insulin, or half \\nthe mixed insulin dose.\\n  • If eating and drinking post-operatively, resume the usual insulin with evening meal. \\nIf\\n AM list (or early PM) and eating a late lunch, give half the morning insulin dose \\nwith this meal. If not eating until evening, a VRIII may be needed if the capillary \\nglucose readings are high.\\n  • Omit all rapid-acting and mixed insulin while the patient is on a VRIII.\\n  • It not eating or drinking post-op, start a VRIII 2 hrs prior to surgery. Aim for serum \\nglucose levels of 6–10mmol/L and check ﬁ nger-prick glucose every 2 hrs. When \\nready to eat, give normal dose of rapid acting or mixed insulin with the 1st meal \\nand stop the VRIII 30–60min later.\\n  • IV ﬂ uid is required while the patient is on a VRIII: see BOX.\\n  • A glucose–potassium–insulin (GKI) infusion can be used as an alternative to a VRIII, \\nalthough it is no longer used as standard in the UK.\\nTablet-treated diabetes mellitus\\n  • If diabetes is poorly controlled (eg fasting glucose >10mmol/L), treat as for \\n patients on insulin (see earlier in topic).\\n  • Give usual medications the night before surgery, except long-acting sulfonylureas \\n(eg glibenclamide) which can cause pr\\nolonged hypoglycaemia when fasting and \\nmay need to be substituted 2–3 days pre-operatively. Discuss with the diabetes team.\\n  • If eating and drinking post-operatively: on AM list, omit morning medication and \\ntake any missed drugs with lunch, after surgery. If PM list, take normal medications \\nwith breakfast, omit midday doses, and take any missed drugs with a late lunch. \\nThe dose of these may need reducing, depending on dietary intake.\\n  • If not eating or drinking post-op, start a \\nVRIII 2 hours prior to surgery. Once eating \\nand drinking, oral hypoglycaemics can be restarted.\\n  • Some patients may need a phase of subcutaneous insulin following major sur-\\ngery\\n—refer to the diabetes team if serum glucose levels are persistently raised.\\n  • Me tformin and iodine IV contrast: Metformin can be continued after IV contrast \\nin patients with normal serum creatinine and/or eGFR >60mL/min.  To minimize the \\nrisk of nephrotoxicity, if serum creatinine is raised or eGFR <60mL/min, stop met-\\nformin for 48h after contrast and check renal function has returned to baseline \\nbefore restarting.\\nDiet-controlled diabetes There are usually no problems; patients should be treated \\nas if no\\nt diabetic (and do not need to be ﬁ  rst on the list). Check capillary blood \\nglucose peri-operatively. Avoid 5% glucose IVI as this increases blood glucose levels.\\nPeri-operative morbidity and mortality Diabetes mellitus is classed as an inter-\\nmediat\\ne risk factor for increased peri-operative cardiovascular risk by the American \\nHeart Association, so screen for the presence of asymptomatic cardiac and renal \\ndisease (p\\n567) and be aware of possible ‘silent’ myocardial ischaemia.  Long-term \\npost-op survival has been found to be poorer for patients with diabetes; h owever, \\nperi-operative cardiovascular morbidity and mortality were only increased in the \\npresence of congestive heart failure and haemodialysis\\n—ie not diabetes alone.\\n_OHCM_10e.indb   588_OHCM_10e.indb   588 02/05/2017   19:0802/05/2017   19:08'),\n",

The bleeding eff ects of aspirin \\nare reversed 5d after stopping—check local policy to see if cessation required.\\nSurgery in those on steroids \\nPatients on steroids may not be able to mount an appropriate adrenal response to \\nmeet the stress of surgery due to suppression of the hypothalamic\\n–pituitary–adrenal \\n(HPA) axis. Extra corticosteroid cover may be required, depending on the type of sur-\\ngery. Consider cover for any patient taking >5mg/d of prednisolone (or equivalent) \\nfor more than 2 weeks or any patient who has had their long-term steroid reduced \\nin the last 2–4 weeks. There is also potential for HPA suppression in patients taking \\nlong-term, high-dose inhaled or topical corticosteroids. A guide to supplementation \\nfollows. Patients should take their normal morning steroid dose.\\n  • Minor pr\\nocedures under local anaesthetic: No supplementation required.\\n  • Moder ate procedures: (Eg joint replacement.) Give 50mg hydrocortisone before \\ninduction and 25mg every 8h for 24h. Resume normal dose thereafter.\\n  • Major sur gery: Give 100mg hydrocortisone before induction and 50mg every 8h for \\n24h.

Minimally invasive surgery is also used for thyroidectomy and par-\\nathyroidectomy.\\nAs a rule of thumb, whatever can be done by laparotomy can also be done with \\nthe laparoscope. This does not mean that it should be done, but if the surgeon is \\nadequately trained, and the patient feels better sooner, has less post-operative pain, \\ncan return to work earlier, and has fewer complications, then there are obvious \\nadvantages.\\n Pre-procedure counselling should always discuss the complications of \\nlaparoscopic surgery (eg accidental damage to other intra-abdominal organs) as \\nwell as the risk of conversion to an open procedure.\\nChallenges of minimal access surgery The \\n2-dimensional visual representation \\nand diff erent surgical approach alters the normal appearance of familiar anatomy. \\nPalpation is impossible and it may be harder to locate lesions prior to resection. As \\na result, pre-operative imaging may need to be more extensive. A new skill has to be \\nlearned and taught.\\nDay-case surgery Advances in surgical techniques as well as perioperative care \\nmean bett\\ner results for the patient (shorter waiting lists, fewer infections, fewer \\ndays off   work, and \\ue000patient satisfaction). Many operations can now be performed as \\nday cases. Theoretically any procedure is suitable, provided the time under general \\nanaesthetic does not exceed ~\\n1h. The use of regional anaesthesia helps to avoid the \\nSE of nausea and disorientation that may accompany a general anaesthetic, thus \\nfacilitating discharge.\\nBear in mind that the following groups of patients may not be suitable for day-case \\nsurgery: •Severe dementia. •Severe learning diffi  culties. •Living alone (and no helpers). \\n•Children if supervision diffi  cult—changes in expectation, delays, and pain relief can \\nbe problematic. •BMI >32 (p244). •ASA category ≥ III (p567) thus potentially unstable \\ncomorbidities—discuss with the anaesthetist. •Infection at the site of the operation. \\nAll surgeons get better over time (for a while), as they perform new techniques \\nwith increasing ease and conﬁ  dence.

But had he tried to do this today, he would have been stopped. \\nThe \\nUK’s General Medical Council ( GMC) and other august bodies tell us that we \\nmust protect the public by reporting doctors whose patients have low survival \\nrates. The reason for this is partly ethical, and partly to preserve self-regulation.\\nWe have the toughest codes of practice and disciplinary procedures of any group \\nof workers. It is assumed that doctors are loyal to each other out of self-interest, \\nand that this loyalty is bad. This has never been tested formally, and is not evi-\\ndence-based. We can imagine two clinical worlds: one of constant ‘reportings’ and \\nrecriminatory audits, and another of trust and team-work. Both are imperfect, \\nbut we should not assume that the ﬁ rst world would be better for our patients.\\nWhen patients are sick with fear, they do not, perhaps, want to know every-\\nthing.

Pulsatile (US duplex may help)?\\nTransilluminable lumps After eliminating as much external light as possible, place \\na bright, thin ‘\\npen’ torch on the lump, from behind (or at least to the side), so the \\nlight is shining through the lump towards your eye. If the lump glows red it is said to \\ntransilluminate—a ﬂ uid-ﬁ lled lump such as a hydrocele is a good example.\\nLipomas These benign fatty lumps, occurring wherever fat can expand (ie no t scalp \\nor palms), have smooth, imprecise margins, a hint of ﬂ uctuance, and are not ﬁ xed \\nto skin or deeper structures. Symptoms are only caused via pressure. Malignant \\nchange very rare (suspect if rapid growth/hardening/vascularization).

They are com-\\nmon on the scalp, face, neck, and trunk. Treatment: Excision of cyst and contents.\\nLymph nodes Causes of enlargement: Infection: Glandular fever; brucellosis; \\nTB; \\nHIV; toxoplasmosis; actinomycosis; syphilis. Inﬁ  ltr ation: Malignancy (carcinoma, \\nlymphoma); sar\\ncoidosis.\\nCutaneous abscesses Staphylococci are the most common organisms. Haemolytic \\nstr\\neptococci only common in hand infections. Proteus is a common cause of non-\\nstaphylococcal axillary abscesses. Below the waist, faecal organisms are common \\n(aerobes and anaerobes). Treatment: Incise and drain. Boils (furuncles) are ab-\\nscesses in\\nvolving a hair follicle and associated glands.

Patients are usually eu-\\nthyroid, but may become hyperthyroid (‘toxic’). MNG may be retro- or substernal. \\nHypothyroidism and malignancy within MNG are rare. Plummer’s disease is hyper-\\nthyroidism with a single toxic nodule (uncommon). •Fibr otic goitre: Eg  Reidel’s thy-\\nr\\noiditis. •Solit ary thyroid nodule: typically cyst, adenoma, discrete nodule in MNG \\nor malignant (~10%).\\nInvestigations Check TSH and USS (solid, cystic, complex or part of a group of \\nlumps). If abnormal consider: •T4, autoantibodies (p216, eg if Hashimoto’s /Graves’, \\nsuspected). •CXR with thoracic inlet view (tracheal goitres and metastases?). •Ra-\\ndionuclide scans (ﬁ g 13.22) may show malignant lesions as hypofunctioning or ‘cold’, \\nwhereas a hyperfunct ioning ‘hot’ lesion suggests adenoma. •FNA (ﬁ ne-needle aspira-\\ntion) and cytologyΩwill characterize lesion. \\ue007A FNA ﬁ nding of a follicular neoplasm \\ncan be challenging (15–30% malignant)Ωdiscuss with cytopathologist and perform \\nmolecular diagnostics where available; if any doubt, refer for surgery.\\nWhat should you do if high-resolution ultrasound shows impalpable nodules? \\nSuch th\\nyroid nodules can usually be observed provided they are:\\n  • <1cm across (which accounts for most; ultrasound can detect lumps <2mm; such \\n‘incidentalomas’ occur in 46% of routine autopsies) and are asymptomatic.\\n  • There is no past history of thyroid cancer or neck irradiation.\\n  • No family history of medullary cancer (if present, do USS-guided FNA).\\nThyroid cancer\\n1\\n      Papillary: (60%.) Often in younger patients. Spread: lymph nodes and lung (jugulo-\\ndigastric node metastasis is the so-called lateral aberrant thyroid). \\ue014: total thyroid-\\nect\\nomy to remove non-obvious tumour ± node excision ± radioiodine (131I) to ablate \\nresidual cells.

Indications: Pressure symptoms, relapse \\nh\\nyperthyroidism after >1 failed course of drug treatment, carcinoma, cosmetic \\nreasons, symptomatic patients planning pregnancy. Pre-operative management: \\nRender euthyroid pre-op with antithyroid drugs (eg carbimazole up to 20mg/12h PO \\nor  propylthiouracil 200mg/12h PO but stop 10d prior to surgery as these increase vas-\\ncularity). Propranolol up to 80mg/8h PO can be used to control tachycardia or tremor \\nassociated with hyperthyroidism (continue for 5d post-op). Check vocal cords by in-\\ndirect laryngoscopy pre- and post-op (risk of recurrent laryngeal nerve injury). Check \\nserum Ca2+ (and PTH if abnormal).

Rare in men (~1% of all breast cancers).\\nRisk factors Risk is related to family history, age, and uninter rup ted oestrogen ex-\\nposure, hence: nulliparity; 1st pregnancy >30yrs old, early menarche; late menopause; \\nHRT; obesity; BRCA genes (p521); not breastfeeding; past breast cancer (metachronous \\nrate ≈2%, synchronous rate ≈1%).\\nPathology Non-invasive ductal carcinoma in situ (DCIS) is premalignant and seen as \\nmicrocalciﬁ cation on mammography (unifocal or widespread). Non-invasive lobular \\nCIS is rarer and tends to be multifocal. Invasive ductal carcinoma is most common \\n(~70%) whereas invasive lobular carcinoma accounts for 10–15% of breast cancers. \\nMedullary cancers (~ 5%) tend to aff  ect younger patients while colloid/mucoid \\n(~2%) tend to aff ect the elderly. Others: papillary, tubular, adenoid-cystic and Pa-\\nget’s (p708). 60–70% of breast cancers are oestrogen receptor +ve, conveying better \\nprognosis. ~30% over-express HER2 (growth factor receptor gene) associated with \\naggressive disease and poorer prognosis.\\nInvestigations (See p82 for history and examination.) \\ue007All lumps should undergo \\n‘triple’ assessment: Clinical examination + histology/cytology + mammography/ul-\\ntrasound; see ﬁ g 13.24.\\nStaging: Stage 1: Conﬁ ned to breast, mobile. Stage 2: Growth conﬁ ned to breast, \\nmobile, lymph nodes in ipsilateral axilla. Stage 3: Tumour ﬁ  xed to muscle (but not \\nchest wall), ipsilateral lymph nodes matted and may be ﬁ xed, skin involvement larger \\nthan tumour. Stage 4: Complete ﬁ  xation of tumour to chest wall, distant metasta-\\nses. Also TNM staging: (p 523) T1<2cm, T2, 2–5cm, T3 >5cm, T4, ﬁ xity to chest wall or \\npeau d’orange; N1, mobile ipsilateral nodes; N2, ﬁ xed nodes; M1, distant metastases.\\nTreating local disease (Stage 1–2.)7 •Sur gery: Removal of tumour by wide local \\ne\\nxcision (WLE) or mastectomy ± breast reconstruction + axillary node sampling/\\nsurgical clearance or sentinel node biopsy (BOX ‘Sentinel node biopsy’ ). •R adio-\\ntherapy: Recommended for all patients with invasive cancer after WLE. Risk of \\nrecurrence decreases from 30% to <10% at 10yrs and increases overall survival. \\nAxillary radiotherapy used if lymph node +ve on sampling and surgical clearance \\nnot performed (\\ue000risk of lymphoedema and brachial plexopathy). SE: pneumonitis, \\npericarditis, and rib fractures. •Chemo therapy: Adjuvant chemotherapy improves \\nsurviv\\nal and reduces recurrence in most groups of women (consider in all except \\nexcellent prognosis patients), eg epirubicin + ‘CMF’ (cyclophosphamide + methotrex-\\nate + 5-FU). Neoadjuvant chemotherapy has shown no diff  erence in survival but may \\nfacilitate breast-conserving surgery. •Endocrine agents: Aim to \\ue001 oest r ogen activity \\nand are used in oestrogen receptor (ER) or progesterone receptor (PR) +ve disease. \\nThe ER blocker tamoxifen is widely used, eg 20mg/d PO for 5yrs post-op (may rarely \\ncause uterine cancer so warn to report vaginal bleeding). Aromatase inhibitors (eg \\nanastrozole) targeting peripheral oestrogen synthesis are also used (may be better \\ntolerated). They are only used if post-menopausal.

Staging investigations should include CXR, bone scan, liver USS, CT/\\nMRI or PET-CT (p739), + LFTS and Ca2+. Radiotherapy (p526) to painful bony lesions (bis-\\nphosphonates , p677, may \\ue001 pain and fracture risk).

It was an ovariotomy for an ovarian mass in a 44-year-old who, prior \\nto physical examination by McDowell, was believed to be gravid. Not only was \\nthis feat performed in the age before anaesthesia and antisepsis, but it was also \\nperformed on a table in the front room of McDowell’s Kentucky home, at that \\ntime on the frontier of the West in the United States. His account of the opera-\\ntion makes fascinating reading. While the strength of his diagnostic convictions \\ncombined with his speed and skill at operating is to be admired (the operation \\ntook \\n25 minutes), there is an even more laudable part played in this story. The \\npatient, Mrs Jane Todd-Crawford, was fully willing to be involved with what can \\nonly be described as experimental surgery in the face of uncertainty.

Prompt laparotomy is sometimes \\nessential: repeated examination is the key to making the decision.\\nClinical syndromes that usually require laparotomy\\n1\\n      Rupture of an organ (Spleen, aorta, ectopic pregnancy.) Shock is a leading sign—\\nsee table 13.10 for assessment of blood loss. Abdominal swelling may be seen. Any \\nhistory of trauma: blunt trauma \\ue003 spleen; penetrating trauma \\ue003 liver? Delayed  \\nrupture of the spleen may occur weeks after trauma. Peritonism may be mild.\\n2       P eritonitis (Perforation of peptic ulcer/duodenal ulcer, diverticulum, appendix, \\nbo\\nwel, or gallbladder.) Signs: prostration, shock, lying still, +ve cough test (p62), \\ntenderness (± rebound/percussion pain, p62), board-like abdominal rigidity, guard-\\ning, and no bowel sounds. Erect CXR may show gas under the diaphragm (ﬁ g 13.26). \\nNB: acute pancreatitis (p636) causes these signs, but does not require a laparotomy \\nso don’t be caught out and \\ue007always check serum amylase.\\nSyndromes that may not require a laparotomy\\nL\\nocal peritonitis:  Eg diverticulitis, cholecystitis, salpingitis, and appendicitis (the lat-\\nter will need surgery). If abscess formation is suspected (swelling, swinging fever, \\nand \\ue000WCC) do US or CT. Drainage can be percutaneous (US or CT-guided), or by lapa-\\nrotomy. Peritoneal inﬂ ammation can cause localized ileus with a ‘sentinel loop’ of \\nintraluminal gas visible on plain AXR (p729).\\nColic is a regularly waxing and waning pain, caused by muscular spasm in a hollow \\nviscus, eg gut, ur\\neter, salpinx, uterus, bile duct, or gallbladder (in the latter, pain is \\noften dull and constant). Colic, unlike peritonitis, causes restlessness and the patient \\nmay well be pacing around when you go to review!\\nObstruction of the bowel See p\\n610.\\nTests U&E; FBC; amylase; LFT; CRP; lactate (is there mesenteric ischaemia?); urinalysis. \\n\\ue022Urine and serum  hCG is vital to exclude ectopic pregnancy. Erect CXR (ﬁ g 13.26), \\nAXR may show Rigler’s sign (p728). Laparoscopy may avert open surgery. CT can be \\nhelpful provided it is readily available and causes no delay (pp732–3); US may identify \\nperforat ion or free ﬂ uid (appropriate performer training is important).\\nPre-op \\ue007Don’t rush to theatre. Anaesthesia compounds shock, so r esuscitate prop-\\nerly ﬁ rst (p790) unless blood being lost faster than can be replaced, eg ruptured \\nectopic pregnancy, (OHCS p262), aneurysm leak (p654), trauma.\\nPlan Bed rest, keep NBM; assess volume status (BOX) and treat shock (p790); cross-\\nmatch/group and save; analgesia (p 574); arrange imaging; consider need for IVI, \\nblood cultures, and antibiotics (eg piperacillin/tazobactam 4.5g/8h IV); ECG.\\nThe medical acute abdomen Irritable bowel syndrome (p266) is the chief cause, so \\nalways ask about episodes of pain associated with loose stools, relieved by defeca-\\ntion, bloating, and urgency (but not blood\\n—this may be UC).

Can occur \\nat any age, though highest incidence is between 10–20yrs.8 It is rare before age 2 \\nbecause the appendix is cone shaped with a larger lumen.\\nPathogenesis Gut organisms invade the appendix wall after lumen obstruction by \\nlymphoid h\\nyperplasia, faecolith, or ﬁ larial worms. This leads to oedema, ischaemic \\nnecrosis, and perforation.\\nPresentation Classically periumbilical pain that moves to the RIF. Associated signs \\nmay include tachycardia, fever, peritonism with guarding and rebound or percussion \\ntenderness in RIF. Pain on right during PR examination suggests an inﬂ ammed, low-\\nlying pelvic appendix. Anorexia is an important feature; vomiting is rarely promi-\\nnent\\n—pain normally precedes vomiting in the surgical abdomen. Constipation is \\nusual, though diarrhoea may occur. Additional signs: R ovsing’s sign (pain > in RIF \\nthan LIF when the LIF is pressed). Psoas sign (pain on extending hip if retrocaecal \\nappendix). Cope sign (pain on ﬂ exion and internal rotation of right hip if appendix in \\nclose relation to obturator internus).\\nInvestigations Blood tests may reveal neutrophil leucocytosis and elevated CRP. US \\nmay help, but the appendix is not always visualized. CT has high diagnostic accuracy \\nand is useful if diagnosis is unclear: it reduces Ωve appendicectomy rate.\\nVariations in the clinical picture\\n  • Inﬂ ammation in a retrocecal/retroperitoneal appendix ( 2.5%) may cause ﬂ ank or \\nRUQ pain; its only sign may be \\ue000tenderness on the right on PR.\\n  • The child with vague abdominal pain who will not eat their favourite food.\\n  • The shocked, confused octogenarian who is not in pain.\\n  • Appendicitis occurs in ~ 1/1000 pregnancies. Mortality is higher, especially from \\n20wks’ gestation. Perforation is more common, and increases fetal mortality. Pain is \\noften less well localized (may be RUQ) and signs of peritonism less obvious.\\nHints\\n  • If a child is anxious, use their hand to press their tummy.\\n  • Check for recent viral illnesses and lymphadenopathy—mesenteric adenitis?\\n  • Don’t st art  palpating in the RIF (makes it diffi   cult to elicit pain elsewhere).\\n  • Expect diagnosis to be wrong half the time. If diagnosis is uncertain, r e-examine \\noften. A normal appendix is removed in up to 20% of patients.\\nTreatment Prompt appendicectomy (ﬁ g 13.27). Antibiotics: piperacillin/tazobac-\\ntam 4.5g/8h, 1 to 3 doses IV starting 1h pre-op, reduces wound infections. Give a long-\\ner course if perforated. Laparoscopy: Has dia gnostic and ther apeutic advantages \\n(if surgeon experienced), especially in women and the obese. It is not recommended \\nin cases of suspected gangrenous per for ation as the rate of abscess formation may \\nbe higher.\\nComplications\\n  • P\\nerforation is commoner if a faecolith is present and in young children,  as the \\ndiagnosis is more often delayed.\\n  • Appendix mass may result when an inﬂ  amed appendix becomes covered with omen-\\ntum. US/CT may help with diagnosis. Some advocate early surgery. Alternatively, \\ninitial conservative management—NBM and antibiotics. If the mass resolves, some \\nperform an interval (ie delayed) appendicectomy. Exclude a colonic tumour (lapa-\\nrotomy or colonoscopy), which can present as early as the 4th decade.\\n  • Appendix abscess May result if an appendix mass fails to resolve but enlarges \\nand the patient gets mor\\ne unwell. Treatment usually involves drainage (surgical or \\npercutaneous under US/CT-guidance). Antibiotics alone may bring resolution. \\n8 There is a second peak between 60–70yrs; older adults may present later with atypical symptoms.\\n_OHCM_10e.indb   608_OHCM_10e.indb   608 02/05/2017   19:0802/05/2017   19:08'),\n",

In small bowel obstruction, vomiting \\noccurs early\\n, distension is less, and pain is higher in the abdomen; in large bowel \\nobstruction, pain is more constant. The AXR plays a key role (ﬁ g 13.28 & p728).\\n2       I s there an ileus or mechanical obstruction? Ileus is functional obstruction from \\n\\ue001bo\\nwel motility (see BOX ‘Paralytic ileus or pseudo-obstruction?’ & p 728). Bowel \\nsounds are absent; pain tends to be less.\\n3       I s the obstructed bowel simple/closed loop/strangulated?  Simple: one obstruct-\\ning point and no v\\nascular compromise. Closed loop: obstruction at two points (eg \\nsigmoid volvulus) forming a loop of grossly distended bowel at risk of perforation. \\nStrangulated: blood supply is compromised and the patient is iller than you would \\nexpect. There is sharper, more constant, and localized pain. Peritonism is the cardi-\\nnal sign. There may be fever + \\ue000WCC with other signs of mesenteric ischaemia (p620).\\nCauses See table 13.12.\\nTable 13.12 Causes of bowel obstruction\\nCauses: small bowel Causes: large bowel Rarer causes\\n •Adhesions (p581)\\n •Hernias (p612)\\n •Colon ca (p616)\\n •Constipation (p260)\\n •Diverticular stricture\\n •Volvulus\\n •Sigmoid (see BOX ‘Sigmoid \\nvolvulus’)\\n •Caecal\\n •Crohn’s stricture\\n •Gallstone ileus (p634)\\n •Intussusception\\n •TB (developing world)\\n •Foreign body\\nManagement\\n  • General principles:  Cause, site, speed of onset, and completeness of obstruction \\ndet\\nermine deﬁ nitive therapy: strangulation and large bowel obstruction require \\nsurgery; ileus and incomplete small bowel obstruction can be managed conserva-\\ntively, at least initially.\\n  • Immediat\\ne action: \\ue007‘Drip and suck’—NGT and IV ﬂ uids to rehydrate and correct \\nelectrolyte imbalance (p668). Being NBM does not give adequate rest for the bowel \\nbecause it can produce up to 9L of ﬂ  uid/d. Also: analgesia, blood tests (inc. amylase, \\nFBC, U&E), AXR, erect CXR, catheterize to monitor ﬂ uid status.\\n  • F urther imaging: CT to establish the cause of obstruction (may show dilated, ﬂ uid-\\nﬁ lled bowel and a transition zone at the site of obstruction—ﬁ gs 13.29, 13.30). Oral \\nGastrograﬁ n® prior to CT can help identify level of obstruction and may have mild \\ntherapeutic action against mechanical obstruction. Consider investigating the cause \\nof large bowel obstruction by colonoscopy but beware risk of perforation.\\n  • Sur\\ngery: \\ue007Strangulation needs emergency surgery. Closed loop obstruction may \\nbe managed with sur\\ngery or endoscopic decompression attempted. Endoscopic \\nstenting may be used for obstructing large bowel malignancies either in palliation \\nor as a bridge to surgery in acute obstruction (p\\n616).

Terminology:\\n  • Irreducible: cont ents cannot be pushed back into place (see p614 for technique).\\n  • Obstructed: bo wel contents cannot pass—features of intestinal obstruction (p610).\\n  • Strangulated: ischaemia occurs—the patient requires urgent surgery.\\n  • Incarceration: cont ents of the hernial sac are stuck inside by adhesions.\\nCare must be taken with reduction as it is possible to push an incarcerated hernia \\nback into the abdominal cavity, giving the initial appearance of successful reduction.\\nInguinal hernia The commonest type in both \\ue032 & \\ue033 (but \\ue032>>\\ue033), p614.\\nFemoral hernia Bowel enters the femoral canal, presenting as a mass \\nin the upper medial thigh or abo\\nve the inguinal ligament where it points \\ndown the leg, unlike an inguinal hernia which points to the groin. They oc-\\ncur more often in \\ue033 especially in middle age and the elderly. They are likely \\nto be irreducible and to strangulate due to the rigidity of the canal’s borders. \\nAnatomy:See ﬁ g \\n13..32 Differential diagnosis: (See p 651.) 1 Inguinal hernia. \\n2 Saphena varix. 3 An enlarged Cloquet’s node (p615). 4 Lipoma. 5 Femoral aneurysm. \\n6 Psoas abscess. Treatment: Surgical repair is recommended. Hernio tomy is ligation \\nand excision of the sac, herniorrhaphy is repair of the hernial defect.\\nParaumbilical hernias occur just above or below the umbilicus. Risk factors are \\nobesit\\ny and ascites. Omentum or bowel herniates through the defect. Surgery in-\\nvolves repair of the rectus sheath (Mayo repair).\\nEpigastric hernias pass through linea alba above the umbilicus.\\nIncisional hernias follow breakdown of muscle closure after surgery ( 11–20%). If \\nobese, repair is not easy. Mesh repair has \\ue001recurrence but \\ue000infection over sutures. \\nSpigelian hernias occur through the linea semilunaris at the lateral edge of the \\nr\\nectus sheath, below and lateral to the umbilicus.\\nLumbar hernias occur through the inferior or superior lumbar triangles in the pos-\\nt\\nerior abdominal wall.\\nRichter’s hernias involve bowel wall only—not the whole lumen.\\nMaydl’s hernias involve a herniating ‘double loop’ of bowel. The strangulated por-\\ntion ma\\ny reside as a single loop inside the abdominal cavity.\\nLittré’s hernias are hernial sacs containing strangulated Meckel’s diverticulum.\\nObturator hernias occur through the obturator canal. Typically there is pain along \\nthe medial side o\\nf the thigh in a thin woman.\\nSciatic hernias pass through the lesser sciatic foramen (a way through var ious \\npelvic ligaments). GI obstruction + a gluteal mass suggests this rare possibility.\\nSliding hernias contain a partially extraperitoneal structure (eg caecum on the \\nright, sigmoid colon on the left). T\\nhe sac does not completely surround the contents.\\nPaediatric hernias include Umbilical hernias: ( 3% of live births). Are a result of a \\npersistent defect in the transversalis fascia. Surgical repair rarely needed as most \\nresolve by the age of 3. Indirect inguinal hernias ( ~ 4% of all \\ue032 infants due to patent \\nprocessus vaginalis —prematurity is a risk factor; uncommon in \\ue033 infants—consider \\ntesticular feminization.) Surgical repair is required. Gastroschisis: Protrusion of the \\nabdominal cont\\nents through a defect in the anterior abdominal wall to the right of \\nthe umbilicus. Prompt surgical repair required.  Exomphalos: Abdominal contents \\nare found outside the abdomen, covered in a three-layer membrane consisting of \\nperitoneum, Wharton’s jelly, and amnion. Surgical repair less urgent because the \\nbowel is protected by these membranes. \\n_OHCM_10e.indb   612_OHCM_10e.indb   612 02/05/2017   19:0802/05/2017   19:08'),\n",

Direct hernias push their way directly forward through \\nthe posterior wall of the inguinal canal, into a defect in the abdominal wall (Hes-\\nselbach’s triangle; medial to the inferior epigastric vessels and lateral to the rectus \\nabdominus). Predisposing conditions: males (\\ue032:\\ue033≈\\n8:1), chronic cough, constipation, \\nurinary obstruction, heavy lifting, ascites, past abdominal surgery (eg damage to the \\niliohypogastric nerve during appendicectomy). There are two landmarks to identify: \\nthe deep (internal) ring may be deﬁ  \\nned as being the mid-point of the inguinal liga-\\nment, ~1½ cm above the femoral pulse (which crosses the mid-inguinal point); the \\nsuperﬁ \\ncial (external) ring is a split in the external oblique aponeurosis just superior \\nand medial t\\no the pubic tubercle (the bony prominence forming the medial attach-\\nment of the inguinal ligament).\\nExamination Look for previous scars; feel the other side (more common on the \\nright); e\\nxamine the external genitalia. Then ask: •Is the lump visible? If so, ask the \\npatient t\\no reduce it—if he cannot, make sure that it is not a scrotal lump. Ask him \\nto cough. Appears above and medial to the pubic tubercle. •If no lump is visible, \\nf\\neel for a cough impulse. •Repeat the examination with the patient standing. Dis-\\ntinguishing dir\\nect from indirect hernias:  This is loved by examiners but is of little \\nclinical use—not least because repair is the same for both (see ‘Repairs’ later in \\ntopic). The best way is to reduce the hernia and occlude the deep (internal) ring \\nwith two ﬁ ngers. Ask the patient to cough or stand\\n—if the hernia is restrained, it is \\nindirect; if not, it is direct. The ‘gold standard’ for determining the type of inguinal \\nhernia is at surgery: direct hernias arise medial to the inferior epigastric vessels; \\nindirect hernias are lateral.\\nIndirect hernias: Direct hernias: Femoral hernias:\\n •Common (80%)\\n •Can strangulate.\\n •Less common (20%)\\n •Reduce easily\\n •Rarely strangulate.\\n •More frequent in females\\n •Frequently irreducible\\n •Frequently strangulate.\\nIrreducible hernias You may be called because a long-standing hernia is now ir-\\nr\\neducible and painful. It is always worth trying to reduce these yourself to prevent \\nstrangulation and necrosis (demanding prompt laparotomy). Learn how to do this \\nfrom an expert, ie one of your patients who has been reducing his hernia for years. \\nThen you will know how to act correctly when the emergency presents. Notice that \\nsuch patients use the ﬂ  at of the hand, directing the hernia from below, up towards \\nthe contralateral shoulder. Sometimes, as the hernia obstructs, reduction requires \\nperseverance, which may be rewarded by a gurgle from the retreating bowel and a \\nkiss from the attending spouse who had thought that surgery was inevitable.\\nRepairs Weight loss (if over-weight) and stop smoking pre-op. Warn that hernias \\nma\\ny recur and patients should be counselled about possibility of chronic pain post-\\noperatively. Mesh techniques (eg Lichtenstein repair) have replaced older methods. \\nIn mesh repairs, a polypropylene mesh reinforces the posterior wall. Recurrence \\nrate is less than with other methods (eg \\n<2% vs 10%). (CI: strangulated hernias, con-\\ntamination with pus/bowel contents.) Local anaesthetic techniques and day-case \\n‘ambulatory’ surgery may halve the price of surgery. This is important because this \\nis one of the most common operations (\\n>100 000 per year in the UK). Laparoscopic \\nr\\nepair gives similar recurrence rates. Methods include tr ansabdominal pre-perito-\\nneal (TAPP) in which the peritoneum is entered and the hernia repaired, and totally \\nextraperitoneal (TEP), which decreases the risk of visceral injury. For beneﬁ  ts of lapa-\\nroscopic surgery see p592.\\nReturn to work: Will depend upon surgical approach and patient—discuss this pre-\\noperatively. Rest for 4wks and convalescence over 8wks with open approaches, but \\nlaparoscopic repairs may allow return to manual work (and driving) after ≤2wks if \\nall is well.\\n_OHCM_10e.indb   614_OHCM_10e.indb   614 02/05/2017   19:0802/05/2017   19:08'),\n",

The TNM sys-\\ntem (Tumour, Node, Metastases see table 13.13 and p 523) is used to stage disease \\nand is preferred to the older Dukes’ classiﬁ  cation (Dukes A: limited to muscularis \\nmucosae; Dukes B: extension through muscularis mucosae; Dukes C: involvement of \\nregional lymph nodes).\\nSurgery aims to cure and may \\ue000 surviv al times by up to 50%. In elective surgery, \\nanastomosis is typically achieved at the 1st operation. Laparoscopic surgery  has \\nr\\nevolutionized surgery for colon cancer. It is as safe as open surgery and there is no \\ndiff erence in overall survival or disease recurrence. •Right hemicolectomy for caecal, \\nascending, or pr\\noximal transverse colon tumours. •Left hemicolectomy for tumours in \\ndistal tr\\nansverse or descending colon. •Sigmoid colectomy for sigmoid tumours. •An-\\nt\\nerior resection for low sigmoid or high rectal tumours. •Abdomino-perineal (AP) re-\\nsection for tumours low in the rectum (\\ue0058cm from anus): permanent colostomy and \\nremoval of rectum and anus. •Hartmann’s procedure in emergency bowel obstruc-\\ntion, perf\\noration, or palliation (p 582). •Transanal endoscopic microsurgery allows \\nlocal e\\nxcision through a wide proctoscope for localized rectal disease. Endoscopic \\ns\\ntenting should be considered for palliation in malignant obstruction and as a bridge \\nt\\no surgery in acute obstruction. Stenting \\ue001 need for colostomy, has less complica-\\ntions than emergency surgery, shortens intensive care and total hospital stays, and \\nprevents unnecessary oper ations. Surgery with liver resection may be curative if \\nsingle-lobe hepatic metastases and no extrahepatic spread.\\nRadiotherapy is mostly used in palliation for colonic cancer. It is occasionally used \\npr\\ne-op in rectal cancer to allow resection.

Beneﬁ ts for stage 2 disease \\nare more marginal and warrant an individualized approach. The FOLFOX regimen has \\nbecome standard (ﬂ uorouracil, folinic acid and oxalipla tin). Chemotherapy is also \\nused in palliation of metastatic disease.

These are averages: black females tend to have \\nmore proximal neoplasms. White men tend to have more distal neoplasms.\\nPolyps are growths that appear above the mucosa and can be inﬂ  ammatory, \\nhamartomatous, or neoplastic. Left in situ, polyps carry a risk of malignant trans-\\nformation that will relate to size and histology (tubular or villous adenomas, esp. \\nif >2cm). Patients with polyps may have no symptoms and thus a colonoscopy is \\nrequired to detect and remove. Colonscopy allows the opportunity to detect colo-\\nrectal cancer at an earlier stage when treatment may be more eff ective.\\nHowever, population-based colonoscopic screening is costly and some studies \\nhave suggested that the test does not impact on deaths from right-sided can-\\ncers which are rarer and harder to detect (ﬁ g \\n13.34). Therefore, the NHS has intro-\\nduced a one-off   screening ﬂ  exible sigmoidoscopy off  ered to all people in their 55th \\nyear. Trial results have shown the incidence of colorectal cancer in the intervention \\n(screening) group is reduced by \\n33% and mortality from colorectal cancer is reduced \\nby 43%.

This FOB-\\nstratiﬁ cation targets screening to those in the highest risk groups, permitting \\ndetection of more advanced adenomas and early stage cancers. The relative risk \\nof death from colorectal cancer in patients undergoing screening is reduced by \\n16%. A 11% increase in incidence rates since 2006 for people aged 60–69 is almost \\ncertainly due to earlier detection through the screening programme. \\nPolyps, the challenges of screening, and the NHS\\nSplenic ﬂexure 2%\\nHepatic ﬂexure 3%\\nAscending colon 7%\\nCaecum 14%\\nAppendix 1%\\nAnus 2%\\nDescending colon 3% Transverse colon 5%\\nSigmoid colon 20%\\nRectum 27%\\nOther and unspeciﬁed 9%\\nRight side Left side\\nTable 13.13 Colorectal cancer: TNM staging\\nTx Primary tumour cannot be assessed Nx Nodes cannot be assessed\\nTis Carcinoma in situ N0 No node spread\\nT1 Invading submucosa N1 Metastases in 1–3 regional nodes\\nT2 Invading muscularis propria N2 Metastases in >3 regional nodes\\nT3 Invading subserosa and beyond (not \\nother organs)\\nM0 No distant spread\\nT4 Invasion of adjacent structures M1 Distant metastasis\\nReproduced with permission from Edge, SB et al.

Dyspepsia (p 59; age ≥ 55yrs with \\ntreatment-refractory symptoms demands investigation), \\ue001weight, vomiting, dyspha-\\ngia, anaemia. Signs suggesting incurable disease: epigastric mass, hepatomegaly; \\njaundice, ascit\\nes (p604); large left supraclavicular (Virchow’s) node (=Troisier’s sign); \\nacanthosis nigricans (p562). Most patients in the West present with locally advanced \\n(inoperable) or metastatic disease. Spread is local, lymphatic, blood-borne, and \\ntr\\nanscoelomic, eg to ovaries (Krukenberg tumour).\\nTests Gastroscopy + multiple ulcer edge biopsies. \\ue007Aim to biopsy all gastric ul-\\ncers as e\\nven malignant ulcers may appear to heal on drug treatment . Endoscopic \\nultrasound (EUS) can evaluate depth of invasion; CT/MRI helps staging. Staging lapa-\\nroscopy is recommended for locally advanced tumours. Cytology of peritoneal wash-\\nings can help identify peritoneal metastases. \\nTreatment See p\\n622 for a description of surgical resections. Early gastric cancers \\nmay be resectable endoscopically (endoscopic mucosal resection). Partial gastrec-\\ntomy may suffi  ce for more advanced distal tumours. If proximal, total gast rectomy \\nmay be needed. Combination chemotherapy (eg epirubicin, cisplatin and ﬂ uorouracil) \\nappears to increase survival in advanced disease. If given perioperatively in operable \\ndisease it improves survival compared to surgery alone. Surgical palliation is often \\nneeded for obstruction, pain, or haemorrhage. In locally advanced and metastatic \\ndisease, chemotherapy increases quality of life and survival. Targeted therapies are \\nlikely to have an increasing role, eg trastuzumab for \\nHER-2-positive tumours.\\n5yr survival <10% overall, but nearly 20% for patients undergoing radical surgery. \\nThe prognosis is much better for ‘early’ gastric carcinoma.\\nAll are rare, have an overall poor prognosis, and are diffi   cult to diagnose. They ac-\\ncount for ~\\n3% of all GI cancers worldwide, but there is geographical variation (\\ue000 in \\nnorth-east Thailand, Japan, Korea, and Eastern Europe). Most are adenocarcino-\\nmas. Primary sclerosing cholangitis (p\\n282) is the commonest predisposing factor in \\nthe West. Presentation: Varies according to location and may include obstructive \\njaundice, pruritus, abdominal pain, w\\neight loss, and anorexia. Investigations: US, CT, \\nand ERCP. MRI has a role for determining extent of invasion in bile duct cancers.\\nTreatment:\\n  • Bile duct cancer: sur gical resection is the only potentially curative treatment \\nyet ~80% present with inoperable disease. Palliation includes biliary stenting \\nand chemotherapy.\\n  • Gallbladder cancer: again, r adical surgery is the only chance of cure. Patients \\nwith a calcified (‘porcelain’) gallbladder have an increased risk of cancer —pro-\\nphylactic surgery should be considered.

Other causes include \\ntrauma, vasculitis (p556), radiotherapy, or strangulation (volvulus or hernia, p612).\\nPresentation is a classical clinical triad: \\ue007acute severe abdominal pain; no/minimal \\nabdominal signs; r\\napid hypovolaemia\\ue003shock. Pain tends to be constant, central, or \\naround the RIF. The degree of illness is often far out of proportion with clinical signs.\\nTests: There may be \\ue000Hb (due t o plasma loss), \\ue000 WCC, modestly raised plasma am-\\nylase, and a persistent metabolic acidosis (high lactate). Early on, the abdominal \\nx-ray shows a ‘gasless’ abdomen. \\nCT/MR may show evidence of ischaemia with CT/MR \\nangiography or formal arteriography if doubt remains. Often the diganosis is made \\non ﬁ nding a nasty, necrotic bowel at laparotomy.\\nTreatment: The main life-threatening complications secondary to acute mesenteric \\nischaemia ar\\ne 1 septic peritonitis and 2 progression of a systemic inﬂ ammatory re-\\nsponse syndrome (SIRS) to multi-organ failure, mediated by bacterial translocation \\nacross the dying gut wall. Resuscitation with ﬂ uid, antibiotics (eg piperacillin/tazo-\\nbactam, see table 9.3, p386), and, usually, LMWH/heparin are required. If arteriogra-\\nphy is done, thrombolytics may be infused locally via the catheter. At surgery, dead \\nbowel must be removed. Revascularization may be attempted on potentially viable \\nbowel but it is a diffi   cult process and often needs a \\n2nd laparotomy.\\nPrognosis:  Poor for arterial thrombosis and non-occlusive disease (<40% survive), \\nthough not so bad for venous and embolic ischaemia.\\n2 Chronic mesenteric ischaemia (AKA intestinal angina.) The triad of severe, colicky \\npost-pr\\nandial abdominal pain (‘gut claudication’), \\ue001weight (eating hurts), and an up-\\nper abdominal bruit may be present ± PR bleeding, malabsoprtion, and N&V. Typically \\nbrought about through a combination of a low-ﬂ ow state with atheroma (95% due to \\ndiff use atherosclerotic disease in all three mesenteric arteries). It is rare and diffi  cult \\nto diagnose. Tests: CT angiography and contrast-enhanced MR angiography are replac-\\ning traditional angiography. Treatment: Once diagnosis is conﬁ rmed, surgery should \\nbe considered due to the ongoing risk of acute infarction. Percutaneous transluminal \\nangioplasty and stent insertion has replaced open revascularization. It is associated \\nwith less post-operative morbidity and mortality, but has higher restenosis rates.\\n3 Chronic colonic ischaemia (AKA ischaemic colitis) usually follows low ﬂ  ow in the \\ninferior mesenteric artery (IMA) territory and ranges from mild ischaemia to gan-\\ngrenous colitis. Presentation: Lower left-sided abdominal pain ± bloody diarrhoea. \\nTests: CT may be helpful but lower GI endoscopy is ‘gold-standard’. Treatment: Usu-\\nally conserv\\native with ﬂ uid replacement and antibiotics. Most recover but subse-\\nquent development of ischaemic strictures is common. Gangrenous ischaemic colitis \\n(presenting with peritonitis and hypovolaemic shock) requires prompt resuscitation \\nfollowed by resection of the aff ected bowel and stoma formation.

Bariatric surgery has become very successful at weight \\nreduction, symptom improvement, and improving quality of life. Surgery increases \\nlife expectancy by around \\n3 years (but may not prolong survival in high-risk men). \\nIndications: According to NICE guidelines,9 weight-loss surgery in adults should be \\nconsidered if all the following criteria are met:\\n1       BMI ≥40 (or ≥35 with signiﬁ cant comorbidities that could improve with \\ue001weight).\\n2       Failure of non-surgical management to achieve and maintain clinically beneﬁ cial \\nw\\neight loss for 6 months.\\n3       Fitness for surgery and anaesthesia.\\n4       Intensive management in tier 3 service (provides guidance on diet, physical ac-\\ntivity, and psychosocial concerns, as well as lifelong medical monitoring).\\n5       The patient must be well informed and motivated.\\nIf BMI ≥50, or in newly diagnosed T2DM with BMI ≥30, surgery is recommended as \\nﬁ rst-line treatment.\\nComparison with medical therapy Surgery is more eff  ective in achieving weight \\nloss than non-surgical management and weight loss is more likely to be maintained \\nin the longer term. Adverse events are more common following surgery, and vary \\nfrom one procedure to another.\\nProcedures There are two main mechanisms causing weight loss: \\n1 Restriction of \\ncalorie intak\\ne by reducing stomach capacity. 2 Malabsorption of nutrients by reduc-\\ning the length of functional small bowel. NB: This also aff ects the levels of circulating \\ngut peptides (eg PYY and GLP-1), which are thought to play a role in the mechanism of \\nsatiety and weight loss. Choose surgical intervention jointly with patient:\\n  • L aparoscopic adjustable gastric banding (LAGB): This restrictive technique creates a \\npre-stomach pouch by placing a silicone band around the top of the stomach, which \\nserves as a new smaller stomach. The band can be adjusted by addition or removal of \\nsaline through a subcutaneous port (see ﬁ g \\n13.40). LAGB is associated with improve-\\nments in comorbidities and quality of life. Weight loss is slower and less than with \\ngastric bypass but there is lower mortality and fewer complications. Relatively non-\\ninvasive and band removal possible. Complications: pouch enlargement, band slip, \\nband erosion, and port infection/breakage.\\n  • Slee\\nve gastrectomy: (ﬁ g 13.41) Involves division of the stomach vertically, reduc-\\ning it in siz\\ne by about 75%. The pyloric valve at the bottom of the stomach is left \\nintact so function and digestion are unaltered. The procedure is not reversible \\nand may be a ﬁ rst stage for progression to Roux-en-Y gastric bypass or duodenal \\nswitch in very obese patients where a single-stage procedure would be technically \\ndiffi  cult or unsafe.\\n  • R\\noux-en-Y gastric bypass: (ﬁ  g 13.42) Laparoscopic or open. A portion of the jeju-\\nnum is attached to a small stomach pouch to allow food to bypass the distal stom-\\nach, duodenum, and proximal jejunum. It can be performed laparoscopically and \\nworks by both restriction and malabsorption. Mean excess weight loss at \\n5 years \\nis 62.8%. Current evidence demonstrates greater weight loss, greater resolution of \\ncomorbidities, and lower reoperation rates compared to LAGB. Complications: mi-\\ncronutrient deﬁ ciency (requires vitamin supplementation and lifelong follow-up/\\nblood tests), dumping syndrome, wound infection, hernias, malabsorption, diar-\\nrhoea, and a mortality of \\n<0.5% (at experienced centres). \\n_OHCM_10e.indb   626_OHCM_10e.indb   626 02/05/2017   19:0802/05/2017   19:08'),\n",

AXR may identify obstruction or free air (perforation).\\nDiverticular disease Altered bowel habit ± left-sided colic r elieved by defecation; \\nnausea and ﬂ atulence. High-ﬁ bre diets do not help symptoms; try antispasmodics, \\neg mebeverine 135mg/8h PO. Surgical resection occasionally resorted to.\\nDiverticulitis features above + pyrexia, \\ue000WCC, \\ue000CRP/ESR, a tender colon ± localized or \\ngeneralized peritonism. Mild attacks can be treated at home with bowel rest (ﬂ uids \\nonly) ± antibiotics. If ﬂ uids and pain not tolerated, admit for analgesia, NBM, IV ﬂ uids \\nand IV antibiotics. Most attacks settle but complications include abscess formation \\n(neces sitating percutaneous CT-guided drainage), or perforation. \\ue007Beware diverticu-\\nlitis in immunocompr\\nomised patients (eg on steroids) who often have few symptoms \\nand may present late.\\nSurgery The need for surgery is reﬂ  ected by the degree of infective complications:\\nStage 1 Pericolic or mesenteric abscess Surgery rarely needed\\nStage 2 Walled off   or pelvic abscess May resolve without surgery\\nStage 3 Generalized purulent peritonitis Surgery required\\nStage 4 Generalized faecal peritonitis Surgery required\\nIndications for elective surgery include stenosis, ﬁ stulae, or recurrent bleeding.\\nComplications \\ue007\\ue007P erforation: There is ileus, peritonitis ± shock. Mortalit y: 40%. \\nManage as for an acute abdomen. At laparotomy a Hartmann’s procedure may be \\nperformed (p\\n582). Primary anastomosis is possible in selected patients. Emergency \\nlaparoscopic management is an emerging alternative. \\n  • Haemorrhage is usually sudden and painless. It is a common cause of big rectal \\nbleeds (p629). Embolization (at angiography) or colonic resection only necessary \\nif ongoing massive bleeding and colonoscopic haemostasis has been unsuccessful.\\n  • Fis tulae: Enterocolic, colovaginal, or colovesical (pneumaturia ± intr actable UTIS). \\nTreatment is surgical, eg colonic resection.\\n  • Abscesses , eg with swinging fever, leucocytosis, and localizing signs, eg boggy \\nr\\nectal mass (pelvic abscess —drain rectally). If no localizing signs, remember the \\naphorism: pus somewhere, pus nowhere = pus under the diaphragm . A sub-\\nphrenic abscess is a horrible way to die, so do an urgent ultrasound.

Causes: Most are due to hard faeces. Spasm \\nma\\ny constrict the inferior rectal artery, causing ischaemia, making healing diffi  cult \\nand perpetuating the problem. Rare causes (multiple ± lateral): syphilis; herpes; \\ntrauma; Crohn’s; anal cancer; psoriasis. Groin nodes suggest a complicating factor \\n(eg immunosuppression/HIV). \\ue057: 5% lidocaine ointment + GTN ointment (0.2–0.4%) or \\ntopical diltiazem (2%) ; dietary ﬁ bre, ﬂ uids, stool softener, and hygiene advice. Botu-\\nlinum toxin injection (2nd line) and topical diltiazem (2%) are at least as eff ective as \\nGTN with fewer side-eff ects. If conservative measures fail, surgical options include \\nlateral partial internal sphincterotomy.  \\nFistula-in-ano A track communicates between the skin and anal canal/rectum. \\nBlock\\nage of deep intramuscular gland ducts is thought to predispose to the forma-\\ntion of abscesses, which discharge to form the ﬁ stula. Goodsall’s rule determines \\nthe path o\\nf the ﬁ stula track: if anterior, the track is in a straight line (radial); if poste-\\nrior, the internal opening is always at the 6 o’clock position, taking a tortuous course. \\nCauses: perianal sepsis, abscesses (see later in topic), Crohn’s disease, TB, diverticu-\\nlar disease, rectal carcinoma, immunocompromise. Tests: MRI; endoanal US scan. \\ue057: \\nFistulo\\nt omy + excision.

It appears as a 2–4mm ‘dark blueberry’ under the skin \\nat the anal margin. It may be evacuated under LA or left to resolve spontaneously.\\nPilonidal sinus Obstruction of natal cleft hair follicles ~6cm above the anus. In-\\ngrowing of hair excites a foreign body reaction and may cause secondary tracks to \\nopen laterally ± abscesses, with foul-smelling discharge.

Off  er hygiene and hair removal advice.\\nRectal prolapse The mucosa (partial/type 1), or all layers (complete/type 2—more \\ncommon), may protrude through the anus. Incontinence in 75%. It is due to a lax \\nsphincter, prolonged straining, and related to chronic neurological and psychological \\ndisorders. \\ue057: Abdominal appr\\n oach: ﬁ  x rectum to sacrum (rectopexy) ± mesh inser-\\ntion ± rectosigmoidectomy. Laparoscopic rectoplexy is as eff  ective as open repair. \\nPerineal approach: Delorme’s procedure (resect close to dentate line and suture \\nmucosal boundaries), anal encirclement with a Thiersch wire.\\nPerianal warts Condylomata acuminata (viral warts) are treated with podoph\\n yllo-\\ntoxin or imiquimod or cryotherapy/surgical excision.

The anus is lined mainly by discontinuous masses of spongy vascular tis-\\nsue—the anal cushions, which contribute to anal closure. Viewed from the lithotomy \\nposition, the three anal cushions are at 3, 7, and 11 o’clock (where the three major \\narteries that feed the vascular plexuses enter the anal canal). They are attached \\nby smooth muscle and elastic tissue, but are prone to displacement and disrup-\\ntion, either singly or together. The eff ects of gravity (standing), increased anal tone \\n(?stress), and the eff ects of straining at stool may make them become both bulky \\nand loose, and so to protrude to form piles (Latin pila, meaning a ball). They are \\nvulnerable to trauma (eg from hard stools) and bleed readily from the capillaries \\n(bright red blood) of the underlying lamina propria. \\nNB: piles are not varicose veins.\\nAs there are no sensory ﬁ bres above the dentate line (squamomucosal junction), \\npiles are not painful unless they thrombose when they protrude and are gripped by \\nthe anal sphincter, blocking venous return. See ﬁ g \\n13.44.\\nDiff er ential diagnosis Perianal haematoma; anal ﬁ  ssure; abscess; tumour; proctalgia \\nfugax. \\ue007Never ascribe rectal bleeding to piles without examination or investigation.\\nCauses Constipation with prolonged straining is a key factor. In many the bowel \\nhabit ma\\ny be normal. Congestion from a pelvic tumour, pregnancy, CCF, or portal \\nhypertension are important in only a minority of cases. \\ue007Elicit red ﬂ ags in history.\\nPathogenesis There is a vicious circle: vascular cushions protrude through a tight \\nanus, become mor\\ne congested, and hypertrophy to protrude again more readily. \\nThese protrusions may then strangulate. See table 13.15 for classiﬁ cation.\\nSymptoms Bright red rectal bleeding, often coating stools, on the tissue, or drip-\\nping int\\no the pan after defecation. There may be mucous discharge and pruritus ani. \\nSevere anaemia may occur. Symptoms such as weight loss, tenesmus, and change in \\nbowel habit should prompt thoughts of other pathology. \\ue007In all rectal bleeding do:\\n  • An abdominal examination to rule out other diseases.\\n  •\\nPR exam: prolapsing piles are obvious. Internal haemorrhoids are not palpable.\\n  • Colonoscopy/ﬂ exible sigmoidoscopy to exclude proximal pathology if \\ue00650 years old.\\nTreatment  1 Medical: (1st-degree.) \\ue000Fluid and fibre is key ± topical analgesics & \\nstool softener (bulk forming). Topical steroids for short periods only.\\n2 Non-operative: (2nd & 3rd degree, or 1st degree if medical therapy failed.) •Rubber  \\nband ligation. Cheap, but needs skill. Banding produces an ulcer to anchor the mu-\\ncosa (SE: bleeding, infection; pain). It has the lowest recurrence rate. •Scler osants.  \\n(1st- or 2nd-degree.) 2mL of 5% phenol in oil is injected into the pile above the den-\\ntate line, inducing ﬁ brotic reaction. Recurrence higher (SE: impotence; prostatitis). \\n•Infr a-red coagulation. Applied to localized areas of piles, it works by coagulating \\nv\\nessels and tethering mucosa to subcutaneous tissue. It is as successful as banding \\nand may be less painful. •Bipolar diatherm y and direct current electrotherapy.  \\nCauses coagulation and ﬁ \\nbrosis after local application of heat. Success rates are simi-\\nlar to those of infrared coagulation, and complication rates are low.\\n3 Surgery: •Excisional haemor rhoid ectomy is the most eff ective treatment (excision \\nof piles ± ligation of vascular pedicles, as day-case surgery, needing ~2wks off  work). \\nScalpel, electrocautery, or laser may be used. •St apled haemorrhoidopexy  (procedure \\nf\\nor prolapsing haemorrhoids) may result in less pain, a shorter hospital stay, and quick-\\ner return to normal activity than conventional surgery. It is used when there is a large \\ninternal component, but has a higher recurrence and prolapse rate than excisional. \\nSurgical complications  include constipation; infection; stricture; bleeding.\\nProlapsed, thrombosed piles Analgesia, ice packs, and stool softeners. Pain usu-\\nally r\\nesolves in 2–3wks. Some advocate early surgery. \\n_OHCM_10e.indb   632_OHCM_10e.indb   632 02/05/2017   19:0802/05/2017   19:08'),\n",

RUQ pain (radiates \\ue003 back) ± jaundice. \\ue057: Analgesia \\n(see p636), rehydrate, NBM. Elective laparoscopic cholecystectomy (see BOX ‘Early or \\ndelayed cholecystectomy?’). Do urinalysis, CXR, and ECG.\\nAcute cholecystitis follows stone or sludge impaction in the neck of the gallblad-\\nder (GB10), which may cause continuous epigastric or RUQ pain (referred to the right \\nshoulder—see p609), vomiting, fever, local peritonism, or a GB mass. The main dif-\\nference from biliary colic is the inﬂ ammatory component (local peritonism, fever, \\nWCC\\ue000; see table 13.16). If the stone moves to the CBD, obstructive jaundice and cholan-\\ngitis may occur—see BOX ‘Complications of gallstones’. Murphy’s sign: lay 2 ﬁ ngers \\nover the RUQ; ask patient to breathe in. This causes pain & arrest of inspiration as \\nan inﬂ amed GB impinges on your ﬁ ngers. It is only +ve if the same test in the LUQ \\ndoes not cause pain. A phlegmon (RUQ mass of inﬂ  amed adherent omentum and \\nbowel) may be palpable. Tests: \\ue000WCC, US—a thick-walled, shrunken GB (also seen in \\nchronic disease), peri cholecystic ﬂ uid, stones, CBD (dilated if >6mm). Plain AXR only \\nshows ~10% of gallstones; it may identify a ‘porcelain’ GB (associated risk of cancer). \\nTreatment: NBM, pain relief, IVI, and antibiotics, eg co-amoxiclav 625mg/8h IV. Lapa-\\nroscopic cholecystectomy is the treatment of choice for all patients ﬁ t for GA. Open \\nsurgery is required if there is GB perforation.

If US shows a di-\\nlated CBD with stones, ERCP (p742) + sphincterotomy before surgery. If symptoms per-\\nsist post-surgery consider hiatus hernia/IBS/peptic ulcer/chronic pancreatitis/tumour.\\nOther presentations\\n  • Obs\\ntructive jaundice with CBD stones: (See p272.) If LFT worsening, ERCP with \\nsphincterotomy ± biliary trawl, then cholecystectomy may be needed, or open sur-\\ngery with CBD exploration.

Causing RUQ pain, jaundice, and rigors (Charcot’s \\ntriad, BOX ‘Complications of gallstones’). Treat with, eg piperacillin/tazobactam \\n4.5g/8h IV.\\n  • Galls tone ileus: A stone erodes through the GB into the duodenum; it may then \\nobstruct the terminal ileum. AXR shows: air in CBD (= pneumobilia), small bowel ﬂ uid \\nlevels, and a stone.

Obstruction may occur anywhere from the renal calyces to the \\nurethral meatus, and may be partial or complete, unilateral or bilateral. Obstruct-\\ning lesions are luminal (stones, blood clot, sloughed papilla, tumour: renal, ureteric, \\nor bladder), mural (eg congenital or acquired stricture, neuromuscular dysfunction, \\nschistosomiasis), or extra-mural (abdom  inal or pelvic mass/tumour, retroperitoneal \\nﬁ brosis, or iatrogenic\\n—eg post surgery). Unilateral obstruction may be clinically \\nsilent (normal urine output and U&E) if the other kidney is functioning. \\ue007Bilateral \\nobstruction or obstruction with inf\\nection requires urgent treatment. See p641.\\nClinical features\\n  • A\\ncute upper tract obstruction: Loin pain radiating to the groin. There may be \\nsuperimposed inf\\nection ± loin tenderness, or an enlarged kidney.\\n  • Chr onic upper tract obstruction:  Flank pain, renal failure, superimposed infection. \\nP\\nolyuria may occur due to impaired urinary concentration.\\n  • A cute lower tract obstruction:  Acute urinary retention typically presents with \\nse\\nvere suprapubic pain ± acute confusion (elderly); often acute on chronic (hence \\npreceded by chronic symptoms , see next bullet point). Clinically: distended, palpable \\nbladder containing ~\\n600mL, dull to percussion. Causes include prostatic obstruction \\n(usual cause in older \\ue032), urethral strictures, anticholinergics, blood clots eg from \\nbladder lesion (‘clot retention’), alcohol, constipation, post-op (pain/inﬂ ammation/\\nanaesthetics), infection (p\\n296), neurological (cauda equina syndrome, see p466).\\n  • Chr onic lower tract obstruction:  S ymptoms: urinary frequency, hesitancy, poor \\nstream, terminal dribbling, overﬂ ow incontinence. Signs: distended, palpable blad-\\nder (capacity may be >1.5L) ± large prostate on PR. Complications: UTI, urinary \\nretention, renal failure (eg bilateral obstructive uropathy —see BOX ‘Obstructive \\nuropathy’). Causes include prostatic enlargement (common); pelvic malignancy; \\nrectal surgery; \\nDM; CNS disease, eg transverse myelitis/MS; zoster (S2–S4).\\nTests Blood: U&E, creatinine, FBC, and prostate-speciﬁ c antigen (PSA, p530).12 Urine: \\nDipstick and MC&S. Ultrasound (p 744) is the imaging modality of choice for investi-\\ngating upper tract obstruction: If there is hydronephrosis or hydroureter (distension \\nof the renal pelvis and calyces or ureter), arrange a \\nCT scan. This will determine the \\nle\\nvel of obstuction. NB: in ~5% of cases of obstruction, no distension is seen on US. \\nRadionuclide imaging enables functional assessment of the kidneys.\\nTreatment Upper tract obstruction: Nephrostomy or ureteric stent. NB: stents may \\ncause signiﬁ  cant discomfort and patients should be warned of this and other risks \\n(see BOX ‘Problems of ureteric stenting’). \\ue025-blockers help reduce stent-related pain \\n(\\ue001ureteric spasm). Pyeloplasty, to widen the PUJ, may be performed for idiopathic \\nPUJ obstruction.\\nLower tract obstruction:  Insert a urethral or suprapubic catheter (p762) to relieve \\nacute retention. In chronic obstruction only catheterize patient if there is pain, uri-\\nnary infection, or renal impairment; intermittent self-catheterization is sometimes \\nrequired (p\\n763). If in clot retention the patient will require a 3-way catheter and \\nbladder washout. If >1L residual check U&E and monitor for post-obstructive diure-\\nsis (see BOX ‘Obstructive uropathy’). Monitor weight, ﬂ uid balance, and U&E closely. \\nTreat the underlying cause if possible, eg if prostatic obstruction, start an \\ue025-blocker \\n(see p642). After 2–3 days, trial without catheter (TWOC, p763) may work (especially \\nif <75yrs old and <1L drained or retention was triggered by a passing event, eg GA). \\n12 Do venepuncture for PSA before PR, as PR can \\ue000 total PSA by ~1ng/mL (free PSA \\ue000 by 10%).

Gleason grading is from \\n1 to 5, with 5 being the highest grade, and carrying the poorest prognosis. Gleason \\ngrades are decided by analysing histology from two separate areas of tumour \\nspecimen, and adding them to get the total Gleason score for the tumour, from \\n2 \\nto 10. Scores 8–10 suggest an aggressive tumour; 5–7: intermediate; 2–4: indolent. \\nPrognostic factors in prostate cancer\\nBalanitis Acute inﬂ ammation of the foreskin and glans. Associated with strep \\nand staph infections. More common in diabetics. Often seen in young children with \\ntight foreskins \\ue057: Antibiotics, circumcision, hygiene advice.\\nPhimosis The foreskin occludes the meatus. In young boys this causes recurrent \\nb\\nalanitis and ballooning, but time ( + trials of gentle retraction) may obviate the \\nneed for circumcision. In adulthood presents with painful intercourse, infection, \\nulceration, and is associated with balanitis xerotica obliterans.\\nParaphimosis Occurs when a tight foreskin is retracted and becomes irreplace-\\nable, pr\\neventing venous return leading to oedema and even ischaemia of the glans. \\nCan occur if the foreskin is not replaced after catheterization. \\ue022\\ue057: Ask patient \\nt\\no squeeze glans.

Alternative chemotherapeutic agents include mitomycin, \\nepirubicin and gemcitabine. 5yr survival ≈ 95%.\\n  • T2–3: Radical cystectomy is the ‘gold standard’. Radiotherapy gives worse 5yr \\nsurvival rates than surgery, but preserves the bladder. ‘Salvage’ cystectomy can \\nbe performed if radiotherapy fails, but yields worse results than primary sur-\\ngery. Post-op chemotherapy (eg \\nM-VAC: methotrexate, vinblastine, doxorubicin, \\nand cisplatin) is toxic but eff ective. Neoadjuvant chemotherapy with M-VAC or GC \\n(gemcitabine and cisplatin) has improved survival compared to cystectomy or ra-\\ndiotherapy alone. Methods to preserve the bladder with transurethral resection or \\npartial cyst ectomy \\n+ systemic chemo therapy have been tried, but long-term results \\nare disappointing. If the bladder neck is not involved, orthotopic reconstr uction \\nrather than forming a urostoma is an option (both using ~40cm of the patient’s \\nileum), but adequate tumour clearance must not be compromised. \\ue007The patient \\nshould ha\\nve all these options explained by a urologist and an oncologist.\\n  • T4: Usually palliative chemo/radiotherapy. Chronic catheterization and urinary di-\\nv\\nersions may help to relieve pain.\\nFollow-up History, examination, and regular cystoscopy: •High-risk tumours: Every \\n3 months for 2yrs, then every 6 months. •L ow-risk tumours: First follow-up cystos-\\ncop\\ny after 9 months, then yearly.\\nTumour spread Local \\ue003 to pelvic structures; lymphatic \\ue003 to iliac and para-aortic \\nnodes; haematogenous \\ue003 to liver and lungs.\\nSurvival This depends on age at surgery. For example, the 3yr survival after cystec-\\ntomy for T2 and T3 tumours is 60% if 65–75yrs old, falling to 40% if 75–82yrs old (op-\\nerative mortality is 4%). With unilateral pelvic node involvement, only 6% of patients \\nsurvive 5yrs. The 3yr survival with bilateral or para-aortic node involvement is nil.\\nComplications Cystectomy can result in sexual and urinary malfunction.

Before rushing into a barrage of investigations, \\nconsider:\\n  • One study found that incidence of urogenital disease (eg bladder cancer) was \\nno higher in those with as\\nymptomatic microhaematuria than in those without.\\n  • Asymptomatic non-visible haematuria is the sole presenting feature in only 4% \\nof bladder cancers, and there is no evidence that these are less advanced than \\nmalignancies presenting with macroscopic haematuria.\\n  • When monitoring those with treated bladder cancer for recurrence, non-visible-\\nhaematuria t\\nests have a sensitivity of only 31% in those with superﬁ cial bladder \\nmalignancy, in whom detection would be most useful.\\n  • Although 80% of those with ﬂ ank pain due to a renal stone have microscopic \\nhaematuria, so do 50% of those with ﬂ ank pain but no stone.\\nThe conclusion is not that urine dipstick testing is useless, but that results should \\nnot be interpreted in isolation. \\ue007Unexplained non-visible haematuria in those \\n>50yrs should be referred under the 2-week rule. Smokers and those with +ve \\nfamily history for urothelial cancer may also be investigated diff  erently from \\nthose with no risk factors. It is worth considering, that in a young, ﬁ t athlete, the \\ndiagnosis is more likely to be exercise-induced haematuria. Wise doctors work \\ncollaboratively with their patients. ‘Shall we let sleeping dogs lie?’ is a reasonable \\nquestion for some patients. \\nIs asymptomatic non-visible haematuria signiﬁ cant?\\nTable 13.19 TNM staging of bladder cancer (See also p523)\\nTis Carcinoma in situ\\nTa Tumour conﬁ  ned to epithelium\\nT1 Tumour in submucosa or lamina propria\\nT2 Invades muscle\\nT3 Extends into perivesical fat\\nT4 Invades adjacent organs\\nN0 No LN involved\\nN1–N3 Progressive LN involvement\\nM0 No metastases\\nM1 Distant metastasis\\nReproduced with permission from Edge, SB et al.

TURP (p642) & other pelvic surgery may weaken the bladder sphinc-\\nter and cause incontinence. Troublesome incontinence needs specialist assessment.\\nIncontinence in women Often under-reported with delays before seeking help.\\n  • F unctional incontinence: Ie when physiological factors are relatively unimportant. \\nT\\nhe patient is ‘caught short’ and too slow in ﬁ  nding the toilet because of (for exam-\\nple) immobility, or unfamiliar surroundings.\\n  • Str ess incontinence:  Leakage from an incompetent sphincter, eg when intra-\\nabdominal pr\\nessure rises (eg coughing, laughing). Increasing age and obesity are \\nrisk factors. The key to diagnosis is the loss of small (but often frequent) amounts \\nof urine when coughing etc. Examine for pelvic ﬂ  oor weakness/prolapse/pelvic \\nmasses. Look for cough leak on standing and with full bladder. Stress incontinence \\nis common in pregnancy and following birth. It occurs to some degree in ~\\n50% of \\npost-menopausal women. In elderly women, pelvic ﬂ  oor weakness, eg with uterine \\nprolapse or urethrocele (\\nOHCS p290), is a very common association.\\n  • Ur ge incontinence/overactive bladder syndrome:  The urge to urinate is quickly \\nfollowed by uncon t rollable and sometimes complete emptying of the bladder as \\nthe detrusor muscle contracts. Urgency/leaking is precipitated by: arriving home \\n(latchkey incontinence, a conditioned reﬂ ex); cold; the sound of running water; caf-\\nfeine; and obesity. \\n\\ue059 : urodynamic studies. Cause: detrusor overactivity (see table \\n13.20), eg from central inhibitory pathway malfunction or sensitization of peripher-\\nal aff  erent terminals in the bladder; or a bladder muscle problem. Check for organic \\nbrain damage (eg stroke; Parkinson’s; dementia). Other causes: urinary infection; \\ndiabetes; diuretics; atrophic vaginitis; urethritis.\\nIn both sexes incontinence may result from confusion or sedation. Occasionally it \\nmay be purposeful (eg preventing admission to an old people’s home) or due to anger.\\nManagement \\ue007Eff \\nective treatment can have a huge impact on quality of life.\\nCheck for: UTI; DM; diuretic use; faecal impaction; palpable bladder; GFR.\\n  • Str ess incontinence:  Pelvic ﬂ  oor exercises are 1st line ( 8 contractions ≈3/d for \\n3 months). Intravaginal electrical stimulation may also be eff  ective, but is not \\nacceptable to many women. A ring pessary may help uterine prolapse, eg while \\nawaiting surgical repair. Surgical options (eg tension-free vaginal tape) aim to sta-\\nbilize the mid-urethra. Urethral bulking also available. Medical options: duloxetine \\n40mg/12h PO (50% have ≥50% \\ue001 in incontinence episodes). SE = nausea. \\n  • Ur ge incontinence: The patient (or carer) should complete an ‘incontinence’ chart \\nf\\nor 3d to deﬁ ne the pattern of incontinence. Examine for spinal cord and CNS signs \\n(including cognitive test, p64); and for vaginitis (if postmenopausal). Vaginitis can \\nbe treated with topical oestrogen therapy for a limited period. Bladder training \\n(may include pelvic ﬂ  oor exercises) and weight loss are important. Drugs may help \\nreduce night-time incontinence (see \\nBOX) but can be disappointing. Consider aids, \\neg absorbent pad. If \\ue032 consider a condom catheter.\\n\\ue007Do urodynamic assessment (cystometry & urine ﬂ ow rate measurement) before \\nany surgical intervention to exclude detrusor overactivity or sphincter dyssynergia.\\n_OHCM_10e.indb   648_OHCM_10e.indb   648 02/05/2017   19:0802/05/2017   19:08'),\n",

If surgery is performed in <6h the \\nsalvage rate is 90–100%; if >24h it is 0–10%.\\n\\ue007If in any doubt, surgery is required. If suspected refer immediately to urology.\\nSymptoms: Sudden onset of pain in one testis, which makes walking uncomfortable. \\nP\\nain in the abdomen, nausea, and vomiting are common.\\nSigns: Inﬂ ammation of one testis —it is very tender, hot, and swollen. The testis \\nmay lie high and transversely. Torsion may occur at any age but is most common at \\n11–30yrs. With intermittent torsion the pain may have passed on presentation, but if \\nit was severe, and the lie is horizontal, prophylactic ﬁ  xing may be wise.\\n\\ue059\\ue059 : The main one is epididymo-orchitis (p 650) but with this the patient tends to \\nbe older, there may be symptoms of urinary infection, and more gradual onset of \\npain. Also consider tumour, trauma, and an acute hydrocele. NB: torsion of testicular \\nor epididymal appendage  (the hydatid of Morgagni —a remnant of the Müllerian \\nduct)—usually occurs between 7–12yrs, and causes less pain. Its tiny blue nodule \\nmay be discernible under the scrotum. It is thought to be due to the surge in gonado-\\ntrophins which signal the onset of puberty. Idiopathic scrotal oedema  is a benign \\ncondition usually between ages \\n2 and 10yrs, and is diff erentiated from torsion by the \\nabsence of pain and tenderness.\\nTests: Doppler US may demonstrate lack of blood ﬂ  ow to testis.

Cause: Degeneration of elastic lamellae and smooth \\nmuscle loss. T\\nhere is a genetic component. Symptoms: Often none, they may cause \\nabdominal/b\\nack pain, often discovered incidentally on abdominal examination (see \\nBOX). Monitoring: RCTS have failed to demonstrate beneﬁ t from early endovascular \\nrepair (EVAR, see later in paragraph) of aneurysms <5.5cm (where rupture rates are \\nlow). Risk of rupture below this size is <1%/yr, compared to ~25%/yr for aneurysms \\n>6cm across. ~75% of aneurysms under monitoring will eventually need repair. Rup-\\nture is more likely if: •\\ue000BP •Smoker •\\ue033 •Positive family history. Modify risk factors if \\npossible at diagnosis. Elective surgery: Reserve for aneurysms ≥5.5cm or expanding \\nat >1cm/yr, or symptomatic aneurysms.

Valves prevent blood from passing from deep to superﬁ  cial veins. If they \\nbecome incompetent there is venous hypertension and dilat ation of the superﬁ cial \\nveins occurs. Risk factors: Prolonged standing, obesity, pregnancy, family history, \\nand contr\\naceptive pill. Causes: Primary mechanical factors (in ~95%); secondary to \\nobstruction (eg DVT, fetus, pelvic tumour), arteriovenous malformations, overactive \\nmuscle pumps (eg cyclists); rarely congenital valve absence.\\nSymptoms ‘My legs are ugly.’ Pain, cramps, tingling, heaviness, and restless legs. \\nBut studies sho\\nw these symptoms are only slightly commoner in those with VVS.\\nSigns Oedema; eczema; ulcers; haemosiderin; haemorrhage; phlebitis; atr ophie \\nblanche (white scarring at the site of a previous, healed ulcer); lipodermatosclerosis \\n(skin hardness from subcutaneous ﬁ  brosis caused by chronic inﬂ ammation and fat \\nnecrosis).

Results \\nare as good as conventional surgery at 3 months.\\n  • Endovenous laser ablation (EVLA) is similar but uses a laser. Outcomes are \\nsimilar to surgical repair after 2yrs (in terms of quality of life and recurrence).\\n  • Injection sclerotherapy —either liquid or foam can be used. Liquid sclerosant \\nis indicated for varicosities below the knee if there is no gross saphenofemoral \\nincompetence. It is injected at multiple sites and the vein compressed for a \\nfew weeks to avoid thrombosis (intravascular granulation tissue obliterates \\nthe lumen). Alternatively foam sclerosant is injected under ultrasound guid-\\nance at a single site and spreads rapidly throughout the veins, damaging the \\nendothelium. Ultrasound monitoring prevents inadvertent spread of foam into \\nthe femoral vein.  It achieves ~\\n80% complete occlusion but is not more eff ective \\nthan liquid sclerotherapy or surgery.\\n  • Surgery—there are several choices, depending on vein anatomy and surgical \\npreference, eg saphenofemoral ligation (Trendelenburg procedure); multi-\\nple avulsions; stripping from groin to upper calf (stripping to the ankle is not \\nneeded, and may damage the saphenous nerve). Post-op: bandage legs tightly \\nand elevate for \\n24h.

The normal range (refer-\\nence interval) is usually that which includes 95% of a given population (given a nor-\\nmal distribution, see p750). If variation is randomly distributed, 2.5% of our results \\nwill be ‘too high’, and 2.5% ‘too low’ on an average day, when dealing with apparently \\nnormal people. This statistical deﬁ nition of normality is the simplest. Other deﬁ ni-\\ntions may be normative —ie stating what an upper or lower limit should be. The \\nupper end of the reference interval for plasma cholesterol may be given as 6mmol/L \\nbecause this is what biochemists state to be the desired maximum. 40% of people \\nin some populations will have a plasma cholesterol greater than 6mmol/L and thus \\nmay be at increased risk. The WHO deﬁ  nition of anaemia in pregnancy is an Hb of \\n<110g/L, which makes 20% of mothers anaemic. This ‘lax’ criterion has the presumed \\nbeneﬁ t of triggering actions that result in fewer deaths from haemorrhage. So do \\nnot just ask ‘What is the normal range?’—also enquire about who set the range, for \\nwhat population, and for what reason.\\nWe thank Dr Petra Sulentic, our Specialist Reader, for her contribution to this chapter. \\nFig 14.1 Rosalyn Yalow ( 1921–2011). Trained \\nin nuclear physics, and made good use of this \\nwhen she developed the radioimmunoassay \\ntechnique to allow trace amounts of peptides \\nto be measured in serum using antibodies. This \\nrevolutionized laboratory medicine, making \\nreliable assays for hormones widely available, \\nand underpinned the development of endocri-\\nnology. It was also employed to screen blood \\nagainst a range of pathogens, and the tech-\\nnique is still commonly used today. She was \\nawarded the Nobel prize for her work in 1977, \\nand commented to a group of children that: \\n‘Initially, new ideas are rejected…Later they \\nbecome dogma, if you’re right.

Normal daily \\nlosses are through urine (1500mL), stool (200mL), and insensible losses (800mL). This \\nrequirement is normally met through food (1000mL) and drink (1500mL).\\nIntravenous ﬂ uids Given if suffi  cient ﬂ uids cannot be given orally. About 2–2.5L of \\nﬂ uid containing roughly 70mmol Na+ and 70mmol K+ per 24h are required.1 Thus, a \\ngood regimen is 2–2.5L of 0.18% glucose with sodium chloride with 20–30mmol of K+ \\nper litre of ﬂ uid. Alternative routes are via a central venous line or subcutaneously. \\nHowever, remember that all cannulae carry a risk of MRSA infection: femoral > jugular \\n> subclavian > peripheral, so always resume oral ﬂ  uid intake as soon as possible.\\n\\ue007In a sick patient, don’t forget to include additional sources of ﬂ uid loss when calcu-\\nlating daily ﬂ uid requirements, such as drains, fevers, or diarrhoea (see BOX 'Special \\ncases'). Daily weighing helps to monitor overall ﬂ  uid balance, as will ﬂ uid balance \\ncharts.\\n\\ue007Examine patients regularly to assess ﬂ uid balance (see BOX 'Assessing ﬂ uid bal-\\nance').\\nFluid compartments and types of IV ﬂ uid\\nFor a 70kg man, total bodily ﬂ uid is ~42L (60% body weight). Of this, ⅔ is intracellular \\n(28L) and ⅓ is extracellular (14L). Of the extracellular compartment, ⅓ is intravascu-\\nlar, ie blood (5L). Diff  erent types of IV ﬂ uid will equilibrate with the diff erent ﬂ uid \\ncompartments depending on the osmotic content of the given ﬂ uid.\\n5% glucose: (=Dextrose.) Isotonic, but contains only a small amount of glucose \\n(50g/L) and so provides little energy (~10% daily energy per litre). The liver rapidly \\nmetabolizes all the glucose leaving only water, which rapidly equilibrates throughout \\nall ﬂ uid compartments. It is, therefore, useless for ﬂ uid resuscitation (only 1/9 will \\nremain in the intravascular space), but suitable for maintaining hydration. Excess 5% \\nglucose IV may lead to water overload and hyponatraemia (p672).\\n0.9% saline: (‘Normal saline.’) Has about the same Na+ content as plasma (150mmol/L) \\nand is isotonic with plasma. 0.9% saline will equilibrate rapidly throughout the extra-\\ncellular compartment only, and takes longer to reach the intracellular compartment \\nthan \\n5% glucose. It is, therefore, appropriate for ﬂ uid resuscitation, as it will remain \\npredominantly in the extracellular space (and thus ⅓ of the given volume in the \\nintravascular space), as well as for maintaining hydration. Hypertonic and hypotonic \\nsaline solutions are also available, but are for specialist use only.\\nColloids: (eg Gelofusine®.) Have a high osmotic content similar to that of plasma \\nand ther\\nefore remain in the intravascular space for longer than other ﬂ uids, making \\nthem appropriate for ﬂ uid resuscitation, but not for general hydration. Colloids are \\nexpensive, and may cause anaphylactic reactions. In reality, eff ective ﬂ uid resuscita-\\ntion will use a combination of colloid and 0.9% saline.\\nHypertonic glucose ( 10% or 50%): May be used in the treatment of hypoglycaemia. \\nIt is irritant t\\no veins, so care in its use is needed. Infusion sites should be inspected \\nregularly, and ﬂ ushed with 0.9% saline after use.\\nGlucose with sodium chloride: (One-ﬁ fth ‘normal saline.’) Isotonic, containing 0.18% \\nsaline (30mmol/L of Na+) and 4% glucose (222mmol/L). It has roughly the quantity of \\nNa+ required for normal ﬂ  uid maintenance, when given 10-hourly in adults, but is now \\nmost commonly used in a paediatric setting.\\nHartmann’s solution:  Contains Na + 131mmol, Cl Ω 111mmol, lactate 29mmol, K + \\n5mmol, HCO3\\nΩ 29mmol, and Ca2+ 2mmol per litre of ﬂ uid.

It also makes erythropoietin and renin, and \\nhydroxylates 25-hydroxyvitamin D to 1,25-di hydroxy vitamin D (see p676 for Ca2+ and \\nPO4\\n3Ω physiology). All of these functions can be aff ected in chronic kidney disease \\n(p302), but it is the biochemical eff ects of kidney failure that are used to monitor \\ndisease progression.\\nThe renin–angiotensin–aldosterone system Plasma is ﬁ  ltered by the glomeruli, \\nand Na+, K+, H+, and water are reabsorbed from this ﬁ ltrate under the control of the \\nrenin–angiotensin–aldosterone system. Renin is r eleased from the juxtaglomerular \\napparatus (ﬁ g 7.13, p316) in response to low renal ﬂ ow and raised sympathetic tone, \\nand catalyses the conversion of angiotensinogen (a peptide made by the liver) to \\nangiotensin I. This is then converted by angiotensin-converting enzyme (ACE), which \\nis located throughout the vascular tree, to angiotensin II. The latter has several \\nimportant actions including eff \\nerent renal arteriolar constriction (thus \\ue000perfusion \\npressure), peripheral vaso constriction, and stimulation of the adrenal cortex to pro-\\nduce aldosterone , which activates the Na+/K+ pump in the distal renal tubule leading \\nto reabsorption of Na+ and water from the urine, in exchange for K+ and H+. Glucose \\nspills over into the urine when the plasma concentration > renal threshold for reab-\\nsorption (≈10mmol/L, but this varies between people, and is \\ue001 in pregnancy).\\nControl of sodium Control is through the action of aldosterone on the distal con-\\nv\\noluted tubule (DCT) and collecting duct to increase Na+ reabsorption from the urine. \\nThe natriuretic peptides ANP, BNP, and CNP (p137) contribute to Na+ homeostasis by \\nreducing Na+ reabsorption from the DCT and inhibiting renin. A high GFR (see later in \\nthis topic) results in increased Na+ loss, and high renal tubular ﬂ ow and haemodilu-\\ntion decrease Na+ reabsorption in the proximal tubule.\\nControl of potassium Most K+ is intracellular, and thus serum K+ levels are a poor \\nreﬂ ection of total body potassium. The concentrations of K+ and H+ in extracellular \\nﬂ uid tend to vary together. This is because these ions compete with each other in the \\nexchange with Na+ that occurs across most cell membranes and in the distal con-\\nvoluted tubule of the kidney, where Na+ is reabsorbed from the urine. Thus, if the H+ \\nconcentration is high, less K+ will be excreted into the urine. Similarly, K+ will compete \\nwith H+ for exchange across cell membranes and extracellular K + will accumulate. \\nInsulin and catecholamines both stimulate K + uptake into cells by stimulating the \\nNa+/K+ pump.\\nSerum osmolality A laboratory measurement of the number of osmoles per kilo-\\ngr\\nam of solvent. It is approximated by serum osmolarity (the number of osmoles \\nper litr\\ne of solution) using the equation 2(Na+ + K+) + Urea + Glucose, since these are \\nthe predominant serum electrolytes. Normal serum osmolarity is 280–300mmol/L, \\nwhich will always be a little less than the laboratory-measured osmolality —the \\nosmolar gap.  However, if the osmolar gap is greater than 10mmol/L, this indicates \\nthe presence of additional solutes: consider diabetes mellitus or high blood ethanol, \\nmethanol, mannitol, or ethylene glycol.\\nControl of water Control is mainly via serum Na\\n+ concentration, since water intake \\nand loss are regulated to hold the extracellular concentration of Na+ constant. Raised \\nplasma osmolality (eg dehydration or \\ue000glucose in diabetes mellitus) causes thirst \\nthrough the hypothalamic thirst centre and the release of antidiuretic hormone \\n(\\nADH) from the posterior pituitary. ADH increases the passive water reabsorption \\nfrom the renal collecting duct by opening water channels to allow water to ﬂ  ow \\nfrom the hypotonic luminal ﬂ  uid into the hypertonic renal interstitium. Low plasma \\nosmolality inhibits \\nADH secretion, thus reducing renal water reabsorption.\\nGlomerular ﬁ ltration rate (GFR) Deﬁ ned as the volume of ﬂ  uid ﬁ ltered by the glo-\\nmeruli per minute (units mL/min), and is one of the primary measures of disease \\nprogression in chronic kidney disease. It can be estimated in a number of diff erent \\nways (see \\nBOX).\\n_OHCM_10e.indb   668_OHCM_10e.indb   668 02/05/2017   19:0802/05/2017   19:08'),\n",

Subjects with low muscle mass (eg \\nthe elderly, women) can have a ‘normal’ serum creatinine, despite a signiﬁ  cant \\nreduction in GFR. This can be important when prescribing nephrotoxic drugs, or \\ndrugs that are renally excreted, which may therefore accumulate to toxic levels \\nin the serum.\\nA number of methods for estimating \\nGFR exist, all relying on a calculation of \\nthe clearance of a substance that is renally ﬁ ltered and then not reabsorbed in \\nthe renal tubule. For example, the rate of clearance of creatinine can be used as a \\nmarker for the rate of ﬁ ltration of ﬂ uid and solutes in the glomerulus because it is \\nonly slightly reabsorbed from the renal tubule. The more of the ﬁ ltered substance \\nthat is reabsorbed, however, the less accurate the estimate of \\nGFR.\\nMDRD (Modiﬁ cation of Diet in Renal Disease Study Group):  This provides an \\nestimat\\ne of GFR from four simple parameters: serum creatinine, age, gender, and \\nrace (black/non-black). It is one of the best validated for monitoring patients with \\nestablished moderately severe renal impairment,\\n2 and most labs now routinely \\nreport estimated GFR (eGFR) using the MDRD equation on all U&E reports:\\neGFR = 32 788 ≈ serum creatinineΩ1 . 154 ≈ ageΩ0 . 203 ≈ [1 . 212 if black] ≈ [0 . 742 if female]\\nHowever, a number of caveats exist, so that it is best used in monitoring declin-\\ning renal function rather than labelling elderly patients with mild renal impairment:\\n  • It is not validated for mild renal impairment, and therefore its use for screening \\ngener\\nal populations is questionable.\\n  • Inter-individual variations (and thus conﬁ dence intervals) are wide, although \\nfor each individual variations are small so that a decline in eGFR over a number of \\nserum samples is always signiﬁ cant.\\n  • Single results may be aff ected by variations in serum creatinine, such as after a \\nprotein-rich meal.\\nCockcroft–Gault equation: This provides an estimate of creatinine clearance. It \\nis an impr\\novement on the MDRD equation because it also takes into account the \\npatient’s weight. However, 10% of creatinine is actively excreted in the tubules, \\nand therefore creatinine clearance overestimates true GFR and underestimates \\nrenal impairment. Moreover, the equation assumes ideal body weight and is thus \\nunreliable in the obese or oedematous. Also unreliable in unstable renal function.\\nCreatinine clearance \\n= (140 Ω age) ≈ weight (kg) ≈ [0 . 85 if female] ≈ [1 . 212 if black]\\n0 . 813 ≈ serum creatinine (μmol/L)\\nCreatinine clearance can also be calculated by measuring the excreted creatinine \\nin a 24h urine collection  and comparing it with the serum creatinine concentra-\\ntion. However, the accur\\nacy of collection is vital but often poor, making this an \\nunreliable and inconvenient method.\\nGFR can also be measured by injection of a radioisotope followed by sequential \\nblood sampling (51Cr-EDTA) or by an isotope scan (eg DTPA 99Tc, p190). These meth-\\nods allow a more accurate estimate of GFR than creatinine clearance, since smaller \\nproportions of these substances are reabsorbed in the tubules. They also have the \\nadvantage of being able to provide split renal function.\\nInulin clearance: The gold standard for calculating \\nGFR, because 100% of ﬁ ltered \\ninulin (not insulin) is retained in the luminal ﬂ  uid and therefore reﬂ  ects exactly the \\nrate of ﬁ ltration of water and solutes in the glomerulus. However, measuring inulin \\nclearance again requires urine collection over several hours, and also a constant IV \\ninfusion of inulin, and is therefore inconvenient to perform.\\nEstimating GFR\\n_OHCM_10e.indb   669_OHCM_10e.indb   669 02/05/2017   19:0802/05/2017   19:08'),\n",

Laboratory features: \\ue000Na +, \\ue000PCV, \\ue000alb, \\n\\ue000urea.\\nCauses\\nUsually due to water loss in excess of Na+ loss:\\n  • Fluid loss without water replacement (eg diarrhoea, vomit, burns).\\n  • Diabetes insipidus (p240). Suspect if large urine volume. This may follow head in-\\njury, or CNS surgery, especially pituitary.\\n  • Osmotic diuresis (for diabetic coma, see p832).\\n  • Primary aldosteronism: rarely severe, suspect if \\ue000BP, \\ue001K+, alkalosis (\\ue000HCO3\\nΩ).\\n  • Iatrogenic: incorrect IV ﬂ uid replacement (excessive saline).\\nManagement Give water orally if possible. If not, give glucose 5% IV slowly (1L/6h) \\nguided by urine output and plasma Na +. Use 0.9% saline IV if hypovolaemic, since \\nthis causes less marked ﬂ uid shifts and is hypotonic in a hypertonic patient. Avoid \\nhypertonic solutions.\\nH yponatraemia\\nPlasma Na+ concentration depends on the amount of both Na + and water in the \\nplasma. Hyponatraemia therefore does not necessarily imply Na+ depletion. Assess-\\ning ﬂ uid status is the key to diagnosis (see ﬁ g 14.3).\\nSigns and symptoms Look for anorexia, nausea, and malaise initially, followed by \\nheadache, irritabilit\\ny, confusion, weakness, \\ue001GCS, and seizures, depending on the se-\\nverity and rate of change in serum Na+. Cardiac failure or oedema may help to indi-\\ncate the cause. Hyponatraemia also increases the risk of falls in the elderly. 3\\nCauses See ﬁ g 14.3. Artefactual causes include: •blood sample was from a drip arm \\n•high serum lipid/protein content causing \\ue000serum v olume, with \\ue001Na+ concentration \\nbut normal plasma osmolality •if hyperglycaemic (\\ue00620mmol/L) add ~4.3mmol/L to \\nplasma Na+ for every 10mmol/L rise in glucose above normal.\\nIatrogenic hyponatraemia If 5% glucose is infused continuously without adding \\n0.9% saline, the glucose is quickly used, rendering the ﬂ  uid hypotonic and causing hy-\\nponatraemia, esp. in those on thiazide diuretics, women (esp. pre-menopausal), and \\nthose undergoing physiological stress (eg post-operative, septic). In some patients, \\nonly marginally low plasma Na\\n+ levels cause serious eff ects (eg ~128mmol/L)—don’t \\nattribute odd CNS signs to non-existent strokes/TIAS if \\ue001Na+.\\nManagement\\n  • Correct the underlying cause; never base treatment on Na + concentration alone. \\nThe presence of symptoms, the chronicity of the hyponatraemia, and state of hy-\\ndration are all important. Replace Na\\n+ and water at the same rate they were lost.\\n  • As ymptomatic chronic hyponatraemia , ﬂ uid restriction is often suffi  cient if \\nasymptomatic, although demeclocycline (ADH antagonist) may be required. If hy-\\npervolaemic (cirrhosis, CCF), treat the underlying disorder ﬁ rst.\\n  • A cute or symptomatic hyponatraemia , or if dehydrated , cautious rehydration \\nwith 0.9% saline may be given, but do not correct changes rapidly as central pontine \\nmyelinolysis 2 may result. Maximum rise in serum Na+ 15mmol/L per day if chronic, \\nor 1mmol/L per hour if acute. Consider using furosemide when not hypovolaemic \\nto avoid ﬂ uid overload.\\n  • V asopressor receptor antagonists  (‘vaptans’, eg tolvaptan) promote water excre-\\ntion without loss o\\nf electrolytes, and appear to be eff ective in treating hypervolae-\\nmic and euvolaemic hyponatraemia but are expensive. 4\\n \\ue022In emergency: (Seizures, coma) seek expert help. Consider hypertonic saline (eg \\n1.8% saline) at 70mmol Na+/h ± furosemide. Aim for a gradual increase in plasma \\nNa+ to ≈125mmol/L. Beware heart failure and central pontine myelinolysis.2 \\n2 Central pontine myelinolysis: irreversible and often fatal pontine demyelination seen in malnourished \\nalcoholics or rapid correction of \\ue001Na+.

The worry is of myocardial hyperexcitability leading to ven-\\ntricular ﬁ brillation and cardiac arrest. First assess the patient—do they look unwell, \\nis there an obvious cause? If not, could it be an artefactual result?\\nConcerning signs and symptoms Include a fast irregular pulse, chest pain, weak-\\nness, palpitations, and light-headedness. ECG: (see ﬁ g 14.4) tall tented T waves, small \\nP waves, a wide QRS complex (eventually becoming sinusoidal), and ventricular ﬁ bril-\\nlation.\\nArtefactual results:  If the patient is well, and has none of the above-mentioned \\nﬁ \\nndings, repeat the test urgently as it may be artefactual, caused by: •haemolysis \\n(diffi  cult \\nvene puncture; patient clenched ﬁ st) •contamination with potassium EDTA \\nanticoagulant in FBC bottles (do FBCS after U&ES) •thrombocythaemia (K+ leaks out of \\nplatelets during clotting) •delayed analysis (K+ leaks out of RBCS; a particular problem \\nin a primary care setting due to long transit times to the lab).5\\nCauses\\n  • Oliguric renal failure.\\n  • K+-sparing diuretics.\\n  • Rhabdomyolysis (p319).\\n  • Metabolic acidosis (DM).\\n  • Excess K+ therapy.\\n  • Addison’s disease (see p226).\\n  • Massive blood transfusion.\\n  • Burns.\\n  • Drugs, eg ACE-i, suxamethonium.\\n  • Artefactual result (see earlier ‘Art efactual results’).\\nTreatment in non-urgent cases\\nTreat the underlying cause; review medications.\\n  • Polystyrene sulfonate resin (eg Calcium Resonium® 15g/8h PO) binds K+ in the gut, \\npreventing absorption and bringing K + levels down over a few days.

Calcitriol production is stimulated by \\ue001Ca2+, \\ue001PO4\\n3Ω, \\nand \\ue000PTH.

Chole-\\ncalciferol (vit D3—from animal sources) and ergocalciferol (vit D2—from vegetables) \\nare biologically identical in their activity. Disordered regulation of calcitriol underlies \\nfamilial normocalc aemic hypercalciuria, which is a major cause of calcium oxalate \\nrenal stone formation (p\\n638).\\nCalcitonin: Made in C-cells of the thyroid, this causes \\ue001Ca2+ and \\ue001PO4\\n3Ω, but its physi-\\nological role is unclear. It can be used as a marker of recurrence or metastasis in \\nmedullary carcinoma of the thyroid.\\nMagnesium: \\ue001Mg\\n2+ prevents PTH release, and may cause hypocalcaemia.\\nPlasma binding: Labs usually measure total plasma Ca2+. ~40% is bound to albumin, \\nand the rest is free ionized Ca2+ which is the physiologically important amount (often \\navailable on blood gas analyser). Therefore, correct total Ca2+ for albumin as follows: \\nadd 0.1mmol/L to Ca2+ level for every 4g/L that albumin is below 40g/L, and a similar \\nsubtraction for raised albumin. However, many other factors aff  ect binding (eg other \\nproteins in myeloma, cirrhosis, individual variation) so be cautious in your interpreta-\\ntion.

Either \\nmay be drug induced.\\n  • Drugs: Cytotoxics, thiazides, loop diuretics, pyrazinamide.\\n  • Increased cell turnover:  Lymphoma, leukaemia, psoriasis, haemolysis, muscle \\ndeath (rhabdomyolysis, p319; tumour lysis syndrome, p529).\\n  • Reduced excretion: Primary gout (p548), chronic kidney disease, lead nephropathy, \\nhyperparathyroidism, pre-eclampsia (OHCS p48).\\n  • Other: Hyperuricaemia may be associated with hypertension and hyperlipidaemia. \\nUrate may be raised in disorders of purine synthesis such as the Lesch–Nyhan \\nsyndrome (OHCS p648).\\nHyperuricaemia and renal failure  Severe renal failure from any cause may be \\nassociated with hyperuricaemia, and rarely this may give rise to gout. Sometimes \\nthe relationship of cause and eff ect is reversed so that it is the hyperuricaemia that \\ncauses the renal failure. This can occur following cytotoxic treatment (tumour lysis \\nsyndrome, p529), and in muscle necrosis.\\nHow urate causes renal failure:  Urate is poorly soluble in water, so over-excretion \\ncan lead to crystal precipitation. Renal failure occurs most commonly because urate \\nprecipitates in the renal tubules. This may occur at plasma levels ≥1 . 19mmol/L. In \\nsome instances, ureteric obstruction from urate crystals may occur. This responds \\nto retrograde ureteric catheterization and lavage.\\nPrevention of renal failure:  Before starting chemotherapy, ensure good hydration \\nand initiate allopurinol (xanthine oxidase inhibitor) or rasburicase (recombinant \\nurate oxidase), which prevent a sharp rise in urate following chemotherapy (see \\np528). There is a remote risk of inducing xanthine nephropathy.\\nTreatment of hyperuricaemic acute kidney injury:  Exclude bilateral ureteric ob-\\nstruction, then give prompt rehydration ± loop diuretic to wash uric acid crystals \\nout of the renal tubules, and correct electrolyte abnormalities. Once oliguria is es-\\ntablished, haemodialysis is required (in preference to peritoneal dialysis). There is no \\nevidence for either preventing (see previous paragraph) or treating hyperuricaemic \\nrenal failure.\\nGout See p548.\\nUrate renal stones Urate stones (ﬁ g 14.8) comprise \\n5–10% of all renal stones and are radiolucent.\\nIncidence:  ~5–10% in temperate climates (double \\nif conﬁ rmed gout), 12 but up to 40% in hot, arid cli-\\nmates. \\ue032:\\ue033≈4:1. But most urate stone formers have \\nno detectable abnormalities in urate metabolism.\\nRisk factors:  Acidic or strongly concentrated urine; \\n\\ue000urinary excretion of urate; chronic diarrhoea; distal \\nsmall bowel disease or resection (regional enteritis); \\nileostomy; obesity; diabetes mellitus; chemotherapy \\nfor myeloproliferative disorders; inadequate caloric \\nor ﬂ uid intake.\\nTreatment: Hydration to increase urine volume (aim \\n>2L/d). Unlike most other renal calculi, existing uric \\nacid stones can often be dissolved with either systemic \\nor topical alkalinizing agents. Potassium citrate or \\npotassium bicarbonate at a dose titrated to alkalinize the urine to a pH of 6–7 dis-\\nsolves some urate stones. If hyperuricosuria, consider dietary management ± al-\\nlopurinol (xanthine oxidase inhibitor). \\nFig 14.8 Urate stone.\\n©Dr G.

It may be 1° (age-related) or 2° to another \\ncondition or drugs. If trabecular bone is aff  ected, crush fractures of vertebrae are \\ncommon (hence the ‘littleness’ of little old ladies and their dowager’s hump); if cortical \\nbone is aff  ected, long bone fractures are more likely, eg femoral neck: the big cause of \\ndeath and orthopaedic expense (\\n80% hip fractures in the UK occur in women >50yrs).\\nPrevalence (In those >50yrs): \\ue032 6%, \\ue033 18%. Women lose trabeculae with age, but \\nin men, although there is reduced bone formation, numbers of trabeculae are stable \\nand their lifetime risk of fracture is less.\\n \\nRisk factors Age-independent risk factors for 1° osteoporosis: parental history, \\nalcohol >4 units daily, rheumatoid arthritis, BMI <19, prolonged immobility, and un-\\ntreated menopause. See BOX ‘Osteoporosis risk factors’ for other risk factors, includ-\\ning for 2° osteoporosis.\\nInvestigations X-ray (lo w sensitivity/speciﬁ  city, often with hindsight after a \\nfr\\nacture). Bone densitometry (DEXA—see BOX ‘DEXA bone densitometry’; table 14.5). \\nBloods: Ca 2+, PO4\\n3Ω, and ALP normal. Consider speciﬁ c investigations for 2° causes \\nif suggestive history. Biopsy is unreliable and unnecessary with non-invasive tech-\\nniques available.\\nManagement Loss of bone mineral density may not be entirely irreversible. Age, \\nnumber of risk f\\nactors, and bone mineral density (DEXA scan; see BOX ‘DEXA bone den-\\nsitometry’) guide the pharmacological approach (eg FRAX, which is a WHO risk assess-\\nment tool for estimating 10-yr risk of osteoporotic fracture in untreated patients; see \\nwww.shef.ac.uk/frax),13,14 although DEXA is not necessary if age >75yrs. Lifestyle measures \\nshould apply to all (including those at risk but not yet osteoporotic).\\nLifestyle measures:\\n  • Quit smoking and reduce alcohol consumption.\\n  • Weight-bearing exercise may increase bone mineral density.\\n15\\n  • Balance exercises such as tai chi reduce risk of falls.\\n  • Calcium and vitamin D-rich diet (use supplements if diet is insuffi  cient—see ‘Phar-\\nmacological measures’ later in this topic).\\n  • Home-based fall-prevention programme, with visual assessment and a home visit. \\nNB: hip-protectors are unreliable for preventing fractures.16\\nPharmacological measures:\\n  • Bisphosphonates: alendr onic acid is 1st line (10mg/d or 70mg/wk; not if eGFR <35). \\nUse also for prevention in long-term steroid use. If intolerant, try etidronate or rise-\\ndronate. Tell patient to swallow pills with plenty of water while remaining upright for \\n>30min and wait 30min before eating or other drugs. (SE: photosensitivity; GI upset; \\noesophageal ulcers—stop if dysphagia or abdo pain; rarely, jaw osteonecrosis).\\n  • Calcium and vitamin D: rarely used alone for prophylaxis, as questionable effi  cacy \\nand some evidence of a small \\ue000 CV risk. Off  er if evidence of deﬁ ciency, eg calcium \\n1g/d + vit D 800U/d. Target serum 25-hydroxy-vitamin D level ≥75nmol/L.\\n  • Strontium ranelate: due to an incr eased risk of cardiac problems it should only be used \\nin those with severe intolerance of other agents and without cardiovascular disease.\\n  • Hormone replacement therapy ( HRT) can prevent (not treat) osteoporosis in post-\\nmenopausal women. Relative risk of breast cancer is 1 . 4 if used >10yrs; \\ue000 CV risk.\\n  • Raloxifene is a selective oestr ogen receptor modulator (SERM) that acts similarly to \\nHRT, but with \\ue001 breast cancer risk.\\n  • Teriparatide (recombinant PTH) is useful in those who suff  er further fractures de-\\nspite treatment with other agents.

The most abundant is albumin (see \\nﬁ g 14.12).\\nAlbumin Synthesized in the liver; t ½ ≈ 20d. It binds bilirubin, free fatty acids, Ca 2+, \\nand some drugs. Low albumin: Results in oedema, and is caused by: •\\ue001s ynthesis:  \\nliver disease, acute phase response (due to \\ue000vascular permeability—eg sepsis, trau-\\nma, surgery), malabsorption, malnutrition, malignancy •\\ue000loss: nephr otic syndrome, \\nprotein-losing enteropathy, burns •haemodilution: lat e pregnancy, artefact (eg from \\n‘drip’ arm). Also posture (\\ue000 5g/L if upright) and genetic variations. High albumin:  \\nCauses ar\\ne dehydration; artefact (eg stasis).\\nImmunoglobulins (Antibodies) are synthesized by B cells. Five isoforms Ig \\nA,D,E,G,M exist in humans, and IgG is the most abundant circulating form. Speciﬁ c \\nmonoclonal band in paraproteinaemia (see p 370).

Low  in nephrotic syndrome, malabsorption, \\nmalnutrition, and immune deﬁ ciency states (eg severe illness, renal failure, diabetes \\nmellitus, malignancy, or congenital).\\nAcute phase response The body responds to a variety of insults with, among other \\nthings, the s\\nynthesis, by the liver, of a number of proteins (normally present in serum \\nin small quantities) —eg \\ue0251-antitrypsin, ﬁ brinogen, complement, haptoglobin, and \\nCRP. A concomitant reduction in albumin level, is characteristic of conditions such \\nas infection, malignancy (especially \\ue0252-fraction), trauma, surgery, and inﬂ ammatory \\ndisease.\\nCRP So called because it binds to a polysaccharide (fraction C) in the cell wall of pneu-\\nmococci. Levels help monitor inﬂ ammation/infection (normal <8mg/L). Like the ESR, \\nit is raised in many inﬂ ammatory conditions, but changes more rapidly. It increases \\nin hours and begins to fall within 2–3d of recovery; thus it can be used to follow \\ndisease activity (eg Crohn’s disease) or the response to therapy (eg antibiotics). CRP \\nvalues in mild inﬂ ammation 10–50mg/L; active bacterial infection 50–200mg/L; se-\\nvere infection or trauma >200mg/L; see table 14.6.\\nUrinary proteins\\nUrinary protein loss >150mg/d is pathological (p294).\\nAlbuminuria Usually caused by renal disease (p 294).

Rare outside of \\nJapan, this s\\nystemic vasculitis aff  ects the aorta and its major branches. Granuloma-\\ntous inﬂ ammation causes stenosis, thrombosis, and aneurysms. It often aff ects wom-\\nen aged 20–40yrs. Symptoms depend on the arteries involved. The aortic arch is often \\naff ected, with cerebral, ophthalmological, and upper limb symptoms, eg dizziness, \\nvisual changes, weak arm pulses. Systemic features are common—eg fever, weight \\nloss, and malaise. \\ue000BP is often a feature, due to renal artery stenosis. Complications \\ninclude aortic valve regurgitation, aortic aneurysm and dissection; ischaemic stroke \\n(\\ue000BP and thrombus); and ischaemic heart disease. Diagnosis: \\ue000ESR and CRP; MRI/PET \\nallows earlier diagnosis than standard angiography. \\ue057: Prednisolone (1mg/kg/d PO). \\nMethotrexate or cyclophosphamide have been used in resistant cases. BP control is \\nessential to \\ue001risk of stroke. Angioplasty ± stenting, or bypass surgery is performed for \\ncritical stenosis.

GPA is a mul-\\ntisystem disorder of unknown cause character ized by necrotizing granulomatous \\ninﬂ ammation and vasculitis of small and medium vessels. It has a predilection for \\nthe upper respiratory tract, lungs, and kidneys. Features: Upper airways disease is \\ncommon, with nasal obstruction, ulcers, epista\\nxis, or destruction of the nasal septum \\ncausing a characteristic ‘saddle-nose’ deformity. 6 Sinusitis is often a feature. Re-\\nnal disease causes rapidly progressive glom erulo nephritis with crescent formation, \\nproteinuria, or haematuria. Pulmonary involvement may cause cough, haemoptysis \\n(severe if pulmonary haemorrhage), or pleuritis. There may also be skin purpura or \\nnodules, peripheral neuropathy, mononeuritis multiplex, arthritis/arthralgia, or ocu-\\nlar involvement, eg keratitis, conjunctivitis, scleritis, episcleritis, uveitis. Tests: \\nCANCA \\ndirected against PR3 is most speciﬁ  c and raised in the majority of patients (p553). \\nSome patients express PANCA speciﬁ c for MPO. \\ue000ESR/CRP.

Hans Zellweger, 1909–1990 (US paediatrician)\\nZollinger–Ellison syndrome This is the association of peptic ulcers with a gastrin-\\nsecr\\neting adenoma (gastrinoma). Gastrin excites excessive gastric acid production, \\nwhich may produce multiple ulcers in the duodenum and stomach. The adenoma is \\nusually found in the pancreas, although it may arise in the stomach or duodenum. \\nMost cases are sporadic; \\n20% are associated with multiple endocrine neoplasia, type \\n1 (MEN1, p223). 60% are malignant; metastases are found in local lymph nodes and \\nthe liver. Symptoms: Include abdominal pain and dyspepsia, from the ulcer(s), and \\nchr\\nonic diarrhoea due to inactivation of pancreatic enzymes (also causes steator-\\nrhoea) and damage to intestinal mucosa. Incidence: ~0.1% of patients with peptic \\nulcer disease. Suspect in those with multiple peptic ulcers, ulcers distal to the duo-\\ndenum, or a family history of peptic ulcers (or of islet cell, pituitary, or parathyroid \\nadenomas). Tests: (ﬁ g \\n15.23) \\ue000Fasting serum gastrin level ( >1000pg/mL). Measure \\nthree fasting levels on diff erent days. Hypo chlorhydria (reduced acid production, eg \\nin chronic atrophic gastritis) should be excluded as this also causes a raised gastrin \\nlevel: gastric pH should be \\n<2. The secretin stimulation test is useful in suspected \\ncases with only mildly raised gastrin levels (100–1000pg/mL). The adenoma is often \\nsmall and diffi  cult to image; a combination of somatostatin receptor scintigraphy, \\nendoscopic ultrasound, and CT is used to localize and stage the adenoma. OGD evalu-\\nates gastric/duodenal ulceration. \\ue057: High-dose proton pump inhibitors, eg omepra-\\nz\\nole: start with 60mg/d and adjust according to response. Measuring intragastric pH \\nhelps determine the best dose (aim to keep pH at 2–7). All gastrinomas have malig-\\nnant potential—and surgery is better sooner than later (with lymph node clearance \\ngenerally recommended if >2cm in size). Surgery may be avoided in MEN1, as adeno-\\nmas are often multiple, and metastatic disease is rare. If well-diff erentiated (G1 and \\nG2) somatostatin analogues may be 1st-line and chemotherapy with streptozotocin \\n(if available) + doxorubicin/5-FU is 2nd-line.

The weighting factor for each tissue depends on \\nits sensitivity. The eff ective dose thus provides a single dose estimate related to \\nthe total radiation risk, no matter how the radiation dose is distributed around the \\nbody. This table is certainly not to be learnt; rather it serves as a reminder of the \\nrelative exposures to radiation that we prescribe in practice. \\ue007Remember that \\nUS \\nand MRI involve no radiation, would they provide the answer?\\nTable 16.1 Radiation doses in common radiological investigations\\nProcedure Typical eff ective \\ndose (mSv) CXR equivalents Approx. equivalent period \\nof background radiation\\nX-ray examinations\\nLimbs and joints <0.01 <1 <2 days\\nChest (PA) 0.015 1 2.5 days\\nAbdomen 0.43 0 2  months\\nLumbar spine 0.64 0 3  months\\nCT head 1.49 0 7 .5 months\\nCT chest 6.6 440 3 years\\nCT abdo/pelvis 6.7 450 3 years\\nRadionuclide studies\\nLung ventilation 0.43 0 9  weeks\\nLung perfusion 17 06  months\\nBone 3 200 1.4 years\\nPET head 7 460 3.2 years\\nPET-CT 18 1200 8.1 years\\nReproduced from iRefer Making the Best Use of Clinical Radiology, 7th edition,\\n©Royal College of Radiologists, 2012.\\nTypical eff ective doses\\nThe very nature of ionizing radiation that gives us vision into the human body also \\ngives it lethal properties. In considering the decision to expose patients to radia-\\ntion, the clinical beneﬁ  ts should outweigh the risks of genetic mutation and cancer \\ninduction. These risks can be hard to quantify (and estimates vary wildly\\n—extrapo-\\nlation of eff ects from doses associated with nuclear explosions are likely unreli-\\nable) but even with strict guidelines we still have a tendency to over-exposure in \\nmedical practice. Perhaps the best advice is to be certain of the importance of \\nevery dose of radiation that you sanction, and mindful of the comparative doses \\ninvolved (see table \\n16.1).\\nThe responsibility lies with us not to rely too heavily on radiology. \\ue007Don’t request \\ne\\nxaminations to comfort patients (or appease their consultants), to replace im-\\nages already acquired elsewhere (or lost) simply to avoid medico-legal issues, or \\nwhen the result will not aff ect management. To give an idea of relative doses, a \\nCT of the abdomen and pelvis gives a typical eff ective dose of 500 times as much \\nradiation as a CXR. This important factor also tells us about the preference of \\nultrasound over CT when investigating abdominal and pelvic complaints such as \\nacute appendicitis, especially given the youthful demographics of this diagnosis. \\n\\ue007Unwitting exposure of the unborn fetus to radiation is inexcusable at any stage \\no\\nf gestation—unless the mother’s life is in immediate danger—and it is the respon-\\nsibility of the referring clinician, as well as the radiographer and the radiologist, to \\nensure that this is avoided.\\nJustifying exposure to ionizing radiation\\n_OHCM_10e.indb   719_OHCM_10e.indb   719 02/05/2017   19:0802/05/2017   19:08'),\n",

What information do you need to give? How much? Who do you ask? \\nPut yourself on the other side: what does the radiologist need to know to decide who \\nneeds what imaging and when? Keep the following in mind when requesting (never \\nordering!) an investigation:\\nPatient details Get the patient’s name right! Include hospital number and date of \\nbirth on all r\\nequests.\\nClinical details Think of your clinical question, what answer are you hoping radiol-\\nogy will pr\\novide? It can:\\n  • Conﬁ rm a suspected diagnosis.\\n  • ‘E xclude’ something important (though remember that exclusion is never 100%).\\n  • De ﬁ  ne the extent of a disease.\\n  • Monit or the progress of a disease.\\n\\ue007 Don’t forget to mention pertinent facts that may change the way the investigation \\nis carried out: an agitat\\ned or confused patient may need sedation prior to an MRI \\nof their head. A CT scan on a patient with an acutely raised creatinine may need to \\nbe done without contrast medium. Insertion of a drain on a patient with deranged \\nclotting may need to wait while this is corrected. Include recent creatinine, Hb, and \\nclotting on the form if appropriate. Don’t forget to mention anticoagulants, eg war-\\nfarin, \\nLMWH, and aspirin for intervention requests.\\nInvestigation details What scan do you think is required, and how soon do you \\nneed it? Diff \\nerent clinical questions require diff erent procedures. If you think the \\npatient has a collection, would you like them to drain it? Always state whether in-\\ntervention is required (eg \\nUS abdo ± drain insertion). Remember that the radiologist \\nultimately decides what imaging or procedure they undertake based on the informa-\\ntion you have provided.\\nTips\\n  • Know your patient well, but keep your request brief and accurate.\\n  • Know the clinical question and how the answer will change your management.\\n  • Look up previous imaging before you go; asking for a \\nCT on a patient who had one \\nyesterday makes you look foolish and will not go down well.\\n  • If in doubt, or if the investigation is very urgent, go down to the department in per-\\nson. R\\negard this as an important opportunity: involving a radiologist will result in \\nthe best selection of imaging technique for your clinical question, will help expedite \\nurgent requests, and should be of educational value for you.\\nIf your request is turned down Don’t be afraid to (politely) ask why. If you or \\ny\\nour team still feel it is warranted, look back at the request; did you miss a relevant \\npiece of information that would change the mind of the radiologist? If you still draw \\na blank, try speaking to a radiologist who specializes in that particular technique. \\nMany teams have clinical radiology meetings; think about approaching someone \\nwho appreciates why you are asking that particular question. Alternatively, go back \\nto your team; speak to your senior, who may have a better understanding of why the \\ninvestigation is needed and be able to convey this to the radiologist.\\n\\ue007Remember that there is a patient at the heart of this, and you are their advocate. \\nI\\nf the results of an investigation will change their management then explain this to \\nthe radiologist. Moreover, don’t forget to explain it to your patient. Being whisked off  \\nto the department for investigation and intervention can be particularly terrifying \\nif you aren’t expecting it.\\n_OHCM_10e.indb   720_OHCM_10e.indb   720 02/05/2017   19:0802/05/2017   19:08'),\n",

Check its date. And remember:\\n  • P ractice makes perfect —always look at the image before checking the report, \\nlearning how to distinguish normal from abnormal.\\n  • Unders tand how the scan is done —this makes interpretation easier and helps \\nyou appreciate which scan will give the answer you need. It also gives practical \\nclues to the result —eg a routine CXR is performed in the postero-anterior ( PA) \\ndirection (the source posterior to the patient to minimize the cardiac shadow).\\n  • Use a s ystematic approach —so that you don’t miss subtleties.\\n  • Unders tand your anatomy —virtually all investigations yield a 2D image from a \\n3D structure. An understanding of anatomical relationships of the area in ques-\\ntion will help reconstruct the images in your mind.\\n  • Orient ation —for axial cross-sectional imaging this is as if you are looking up at \\nthe supine patient \\ue007from the feet. F or images with non-conventional orienta-\\ntions (eg MRCP) look on the image for clue markings, or rely on your knowledge of \\nanatomy—it can be tricky to visualize oblique sections!\\n  • R emember the patient —an investigation is only one part of the clinical work-up, \\ndon’t rely solely on the investigation result for your management decisions. Go \\nback to see the patient after looking at the investigation and reading the radiolo-\\ngist’s report: you might notice something that you didn’t before.\\nInterpreting an image\\nEveryone has their own method for presenting, and the right way is your own  \\nway. As long as you cover everything systematically—because we all get ‘hot-seat \\namnesia’ at some point —the particulars will take care of themselves. Continue \\nto polish your own method and remember a few extra tips for when an image is \\npresented expectantly by your consultant/examiner and the ﬂ  oor is yours. A brief \\nsilence with a thoughtful expression as you analyse the image is ﬁ ne, then:\\n  • State the written details: name, date of birth, where and how the imaging was \\ntak\\nen. Look for clues: weighting of an MRI, a ‘+ c’ indicating that contrast medium \\nhas been used, the phase of the investigation (arterial/venous/portal), or even \\nthe name of the organ printed on an ultrasound.\\n  • State the type, mode, and technical quality of investigation\\n—not always easy!\\nGoing through this list also gives you a bit of thinking time.  Then:\\n  • Start with life-threatening or very obvious abnormalities. T hen be systematic:\\n  • Is the patient’s position adequate? Any lines, leads, or tubes? Note their position.\\n  • Just like the bedside clues in a physical examination, there are clues in radiology \\ne\\nxaminations. Note oxygen masks, ECG leads, venous access, infusion apparatus, \\nand invasive devices. Identifying what they are also helps you to look through \\nwhat may otherwise appear to be a cluttered mess.\\n  • Note any abnormalities and try to contextualize these with whatever you al-\\nr\\neady know of the patient. The abnormality may be hiding in plain sight, but if \\nstruggling, step back and note any asymmetry or areas that just ‘look diff erent’.\\n  • With cross-sectional imaging, scan through adjacent sections noting the anato-\\nm\\ny of one organ system or structure at a time (this may mean going up and down \\nthrough a CT abdomen multiple times).\\n  • Giving a diff  erential diagnosis is good practice, as not all ﬁ  ndings are diagnostic.\\n  • If there is additional clinical information that would help you to make a diagno-\\nsis, don\\n’t be afraid to ask. After all, we treat patients and not images!\\nRemember: •X-ray=radiodensity (lucency/opacity). •CT=attenuation.\\n •US=echogenicity. •MRI=signal intensity.\\nPresenting an image\\n_OHCM_10e.indb   721_OHCM_10e.indb   721 02/05/2017   19:0802/05/2017   19:08'),\n",

Mobile images may be antero-posterior (AP, ﬁ g 16.6), magnify-\\ning heart size. If supine, distribution of air and ﬂ uid in lungs and pleural cavities is \\naltered and the diaphragm is elevated.\\nAcclimatize yourself to the four cardinal elements of the chest radiograph, memo-\\nrably (albeit slightly inaccurately) termed bone, air, fat, and ‘water’/soft tissue. Each \\nhas its own radiographic density. \\ue007A border is only seen at an interface of two \\ndensities, eg heart (so\\nft tissue) and lung (air); this ‘silhouette’ is lost if air in the lung \\nis replaced by consolidation (‘water’). The silhouette sign localizes pathology (eg \\nmiddle lobe pneumonia or collapse causing loss of clarity of the right heart border, \\nﬁ g \\n16.2). When interpreting a CXR use a systematic approach that works for you, eg:\\nTechnical quality\\n  • R\\notation: The sternal ends of the clavicles should symmetrically overlie the trans-\\nv\\nerse processes of the 4th or 5th thoracic vertebrae. A rotated image can alter the \\nposition of structures, eg rotation to the right projects the aortic arch vessels over \\nthe right upper zone, appearing as though there is a mass.\\n  • Inspir\\nation: There should be 5 to 7 ribs visible anteriorly (or 10 posteriorly). Hy-\\nperinﬂ ation can be abnormal, eg COPD. Poor inspiration can mimic cardiomegaly, as \\nthe heart is usually pulled down (hence elongated) with inspiration, and crowding \\nof vessels at the lung bases can mimic consolidation or collapse. This is common \\nin patients who are acutely unwell, particularly those in pain or unconscious. Take \\ncare in interpreting these images.\\n  • E\\nxposure:  An under-exposed image will be too white and an over-exposed image \\nwill be t\\noo black. Both cause a loss of deﬁ  nition and quality although some com-\\npensation can be made with standard viewing software.\\n  • P osition: The entire lung margin should be visible.\\nTrachea Normally central or just to the right. Deviated by collapse (towards the le-\\nsion), expansion (away\\n from the lesion), or patient rotation.\\nMediastinum May be: Widened by mediastinal fat; retrosternal thyroid; aortic \\naneury\\nsm/unfolding; lymph node enlargement (sarcoidosis, lymphoma, metastases, \\nTB); tumour (thymoma, teratoma); cysts (bronchogenic, pericardial); paravertebral \\nmass (TB). Shifted towards a collapsed lung or away  from processes that add vol-\\nume (eg a large mass or a tension pneumothorax).\\nThere are three bulges normally visible on the left border of the mediastinum \\nthat help identify pathology if abnormal. From superior to inferior they are: 1 Aortic \\nknuckle. 2 Pulmonary outﬂ ow tract. 3 Left ventricle.\\nHila The left hilum is higher than the right or at the same level (not lower); they \\nshould be the same siz\\ne and density. The hila may be: Pulled up or down by ﬁ br osis \\nor collapse. Enlarged by: pulmonary arterial hypertension; bronchogenic ca; lymph \\nnodes. \\ue007Sarcoidosis, TB, and lymphoma can give bilateral hilar lymphadenopathy. \\nCalciﬁ ed due to: sarcoid, past TB; silicosis; histoplasmosis (p408).\\nHeart Normally less than half of the width of the thorax (cardiothoracic ratio <0.5). ⅓ \\nshould lie to the right of the vertebral column, ⅔ to the left. It may appear elongated \\nif the chest is hyperinﬂ ated (COPD); or enlarged if the image is AP or if there is LV \\nfailure (ﬁ g 16.3), or a pericardial eff  usion. Are there calciﬁ ed valves?\\nDiaphragm The right side is often slightly higher (due to the liver). Causes of raised \\nhemidiaphr\\nagm: Trouble above the diaphragm—lung volume loss or inﬂ ammation. \\nTrouble with the diaphragm—stroke; phrenic nerve palsy (causes, p504; any medias-\\ntinal mass?). Trouble below the diaphragm—hepatomegaly; subphrenic abscess. NB: \\nsubpulmonic eff usion (eff usions having a similar contour to the diaphragm without \\na characteristic meniscus) and diaphragm rupture give apparent elevation.

Decide whether y\\nou are looking at small or large bowel (ﬁ g 16.8; table 16.3).\\nSmall bowel diameter is normally ~2.5cm, the colon ~5cm, the caecum up to 10cm. Di-\\nlated small bowel is seen in obstruction and paralytic ileus. Dilated large bowel (\\ue0066cm) \\nis seen in both these, and also in ‘toxic dilatation’, and, in the elderly, in benign hypoto-\\nnicity.

It \\ncould be: 1 Pneumoperitoneum; signs on the supine AXR include: gas on both sides of \\nthe bowel wall (Rigler’s sign), a triangle of gas in the RUQ trapped beneath the falci-\\nform ligament, and a circle of gas beneath the anterior abdominal wall. Seen with \\nbowel perforation but also after laparoscopic surgery. 2 Gas in the urinary tract—eg \\nin the bladder from a ﬁ stula. 3 Gas in the biliary tree (see next paragraph), or rarely \\n4 Intramural gas, found in bowel necrosis.\\nBiliary tree An y stones: ~10% visible on plain AXR. Any gas: (Pneumobilia.) Caused \\nb\\ny: •post-ERCP/sphincterotomy •post-surgery (eg Whipple’s) •recent stone passage \\n•anaerobic cholangitis (rare) •gallbladder–bowel ﬁ stula: gallstone migrates directly \\ninto the bowel (Rigler’s triad is seen in 25%: pneumobilia, small bowel obstruction, \\nan ectopic gallstone).

Right is lower than \\nthe left (‘pushed down’ by the liver). Their outline can usually be seen due to surrounding \\nlayer of perinephric fat. Ureters: Pass near the tips of the lumbar transverse processes, \\ncr\\noss the sacroiliac joints, down to the ischial spines, and turn medially to join the bladder.\\nOther soft tissues Look for size/position of: liver, spleen, and bladder. A big liver \\nwill push bo\\nwel to the left side of the abdomen. An enlarged spleen displaces bowel \\nand stomach bubble to the right. A big bladder elevates these.\\nMedical devices Double-J and biliary stents, nephrostomy and gastrostomy tubes, \\nintr\\nauterine devices, laparoscopic clips, and peritoneal dialysis catheters can be seen.\\nBones and joints Plain AXR is not ideal, but there may be important abnormalities. \\nIn the lumbar spine, look for scoliosis and degeneration (osteophytes, joint space \\nnarrowing) as well as bone metastases or sacroiliitis.\\n1 Don’t get confused by other calciﬁ cations—eg phleboliths: harmless calciﬁ cations found in the perivesical \\nveins (rounded with a radiolucent centre).\\n_OHCM_10e.indb   728_OHCM_10e.indb   728 02/05/2017   19:0802/05/2017   19:08'),\n",

Within a single slice (eg 0.5 or 5mm thick), CT records the attenuation \\n(=loss of energy from, eg absorption or reﬂ  ection) of diff  erent tissues to ionizing ra-\\ndiation and calculates a mean value for a given volume of tissue (a ‘voxel’). This value \\nis represented in greyscale as a single point, called a pixel, in the ﬁ nal \\n2D image (or 3D \\n‘reconstruction’—ﬁ g 16.13). The greyscale of the pixel is measured on the Hounsﬁ eld \\nscale (see ﬁ g 16.10) relative to the attenuation of water, 0 Hounsﬁ  eld units (HU), and \\nair, Ω1000HU. The human eye and display systems have a limited greyscale range, so \\ndiff erent settings (levels and ‘windows’) are used to focus on diff erences in attenuation \\nin ranges typical for tissues of diff  erent density, eg bone or lung (ﬁ g 16.11).\\n\\ue007CTS are responsible for up to 40% of iatrogenic radiation in high-use settings, which \\ncould account for ~1% of all cancers: always balance beneﬁ ts of CT vs other modali-\\nties with less or no radiation (ultrasound; MRI), particularly in the young or in those \\nwith chronic disease likely to undergo multiple imaging investigations.

NB ultrasound increasingly used \\n(p736).\\n  • Following abdominal surgery.\\nContrast medium (p 748) Enhance anatomical detail by use of a high- or low \\n(water)-attenuating medium to ﬁ ll the lumen of a structure. Give IV to image vascu-\\nlar anatomy (ﬁ g 16.12) and vascular structures (including highly perfused tumours). \\nImages acquired at diff erent times (‘phases’) after injection will show the agent in \\narterial or venous structures or during ‘washout’ ( =clearing). Perfusion CT maps \\ncerebral blood ﬂ ow by acquiring serial images after contrast administration then \\ncombines these into a colour-coded image of perfusion times ( ﬁ g 16.14). Ensure IV \\ncannulae secure and suffi   cient gauge to allow for rapid injection of agent as bolus—\\nextravasation of contrast can cause signiﬁ cant tissue damage. Give PO eg 1–12h before \\nimaging bowel. Give PR for examining distal colonic lumen.\\nContrast-enhanced CTS may include a pre-contrast series. Unenhanced imaging \\nalone reduces radiation exposure and may be adequate for images of the brain, spine, \\nlung, and musculoskeletal system or necessary in those with renal failure (contrast is \\nnephrotoxic).\\nStreak artefact Remember that the \\nCT slice image is a matrix representation of \\nthe attenuation produced by rotating around the patient. High-attenuation items \\nsuch as metal ﬁ llings, clips, and prostheses (and even bone) can cause interference.\\nCT combined with PET (See p739.) Combines the anatomical detail of CT with the \\nmetabolic information of PET, to aid assessment of, eg neoplastic lesions.

MR images are most commonly T1-weighted (good for visualizing anatomy) \\nor T2-weighted (good for visualizing disease) but can also be a mixture of both, called \\nproton density (PD) weighting. FLAIR sequences produce heavily T2-weighted images. \\nA good way to determine the weighting of an MR image is to look for water—eg in the \\naqueous humour of the eye, CSF, or synovial ﬂ uid (see table 16.4; ﬁ g 16.17).\\nTable 16.4 MRI sequence characteristics\\nT1-weighted T2-weighted\\nTR\\nTE\\nShort (<1000ms)\\nShort (<30ms)\\nLong (>2000ms)\\nLong (>80ms)\\nLow \\nsignal\\nWater\\nFlowing Hb\\nFresh Hb\\nHaemosiderin\\nBone\\nFlowing Hb\\nDeoxyHb\\nHaemosiderin\\nMelanin\\nHigh \\nsignal\\nBone marrow\\nFat\\nCholesterol\\nGadolinium (p762)\\nMetHb\\nWater\\nCholesterol\\nFresh Hb\\nMetHb\\nAdvantages MRI’s great bonus is that it  \\ndoes not involve ionizing radiation.

In-\\nstead, it relies on properties of longitudinal sound waves. This has made it a popular \\nand safe form of imaging with increasingly widespread applications. High-frequency \\nsound waves (3–15MHz) are generated in the transducer (transmitter and receiver) \\nby the vibrations of a piezo-electric quartz crystal as a voltage is applied. Passage of \\nsound waves through tissue is aff ected by attenuation  and reﬂ ection. Attenuation \\ndisperses waves out of the receiver’s range, but it is the waves reﬂ  ected back to the \\ntransducer that determine the image. Its quality depends on the diff erence in acoustic \\nimpedance  between adjacent soft tissues.\\nProcessing With the help of software a real-time 2D image is made. During process-\\ning, an average attenuation value is assumed throughout the tissue examined, so if \\na higher-than-average attenuation structure is in the superﬁ cial tissues (eg ﬁ brous \\ntissue, calciﬁ cation, or gas), then everything deep to it will be in a low intensity \\n(black) acoustic shadow. If a lower-than-average attenuation object (eg ﬂ uid-ﬁ  lled/ \\ncystic structure) is in the superﬁ cial tissues then everything deep to it will be high \\nintensity (white) or enhanced. If a tissue interface is strongly disparate, eg gas in \\nthe intestine, then all the waves are reﬂ ected back, making it impossible to image \\nbeyond it. See also ﬁ gs 16.21–16.24.\\nModes B: (Brightness) is the most common, giving 2D slices that map the diff erent \\nmagnitudes of echo in greyscale. M: (Movement) traces the movement of structures \\nwithin the line of the sound beam. It is used in imaging, eg heart valves (p110).\\nDuplex ultrasonography (ﬂ ow and morphology) By combining Doppler eff ects \\n(shifts in wavelength caused by movement of a source or reﬂ ecting surface) with \\nB-mode ultrasound technology, ﬂ ow characteristics of blood can be inferred ( ﬁ g \\n16.21). This is extremely useful in arterial and venous studies, and echocardiography.\\nAdvantages Portable; fast; non-ionizing; cheap; real-time; can be used with interven-\\ntion; can enter organs, eg rectum, vagina, bowel. Endoscopic US can be used to stage \\nand biopsy lung and GI tract cancers, eg stomach, pancreas, and also image the heart = \\ntransoesophageal echocardiogram or TOE, p110. \\nDisadvantages Operator dependent—interoperator variability high; poor quality if \\npatient is obese; interference from bone, bowel gas, calculi, or superimposed organs \\ncan limit depth and quality of imaging.\\nFig 16.21 A normal Duplex US of the right common carotid artery with a ﬂ ow rate=77cm/s.

Nuclear medicine is the opposite; it measures emitted \\nradiation from an internal source, introduced into the patient via injection, inhala-\\ntion, or ingestion. It can be diagnostic (eg PET scanning) or therapeutic (eg radio-\\niodine (I131) ablation in thyrotoxicosis).\\nBecause molecules labelled with radioisotopes are introduced into the patient, \\nthere is exposure to ionizing radiation, though doses are usually less than those from \\nCT (see table 16.1, p719). The selection of molecule for labelling depends on the tissue \\nof interest, as it should be something that will be readily taken up by that tissue, eg \\nbisphosphonates for bone, glucose for fast-turnover tissue. Examples include:\\nVentilation/perfusion (VQ) scan Uses inhaled technetium (Tc) or, less commonly, \\nxenon-133 (133Xe) plus injected 99mTc macro-aggregates, which lodge in lung capillar-\\nies. Normal perfusion excludes PE but ventilation component requires a normal CXR for \\ncomparison (ﬁ gs 16.25, 16.26). Due to the large number of ‘indeterminate’ scans VQ is \\nconsidered inferior to CTPA for the investigation of PE except in pregnancy (see p192).\\nBone scintigraphy 99mTc-labelled bisphosphonates are readily taken up by bone, \\nand concentrate in areas of pathology, eg tumours, fractures. It is much more sensi-\\ntive in identifying metastases than X-ray, where lesions may not appear until >50% \\nof bone matrix has been destroyed (ﬁ g 16.27).\\nThyroid disease TcO4 is used for diff erentiating Graves’, toxic multinodular goitre, \\nand subacute thyroiditis (ﬁ g 13.22, p601) as well as identifying ectopic tissue, func-\\ntioning nodules, and residual/recurrent thyroid tissue after surgery. ~15% of cold \\n(non-functioning) nodules are malignant. Hot nodules are often toxic adenomas.\\nPhaeochromocytoma Iodine-123 (123I) meta-iodobenzylguanidine ( MIBG) is taken \\nup by sympathetic tissues, and indicates functioning, ectopic, and metastatic ad-\\nrenal medullary (+other neural crest) tumours. 131I-MIBG is also used for treatment.\\nHyperparathyroidism 99mTc-methoxyisobutyl isonitrile ( MIBI) scans can detect \\nparathyroid adenomas.\\nHaemorrhage Red cells are removed from the patient and labelled with 99mTc, then re-\\ninjected to allow identiﬁ  cation of a bleeding point. Used in both acute (after endoscopy \\nand CT) and chronic GI bleeding, red cell scans are more sensitive than CT angiography \\nand useful in intermittent bleeding, although localization can be challenging.\\nFig 16.25 Ventilation scintigram.\\nCourtesy of Norwich Radiology \\nDepartment.\\nFig 16.26 Perfusion scintigram \\nshowing mismatches with ﬁ g 16.25.\\nCourtesy of Norwich Radiology \\nDepartment.\\nFig 16.27 Bone \\nscintigram showing \\nmetastases.\\nCourtesy of Norwich \\nRadiology Department.\\n_OHCM_10e.indb   738_OHCM_10e.indb   738 02/05/2017   19:0802/05/2017   19:08'),\n",

If the tracer \\nchosen is 18F-ﬂ uorodeoxyglucose (FDG), a short \\nhalf-life glucose analogue, it becomes concen-\\ntrated in metabolically active tissues. FDG de-\\ncays rapidly to produce a positron that, after travelling a few millimetres through \\ntissue, annihilates with an electron to produce a pair of high-energy photons (gamma \\nrays), which PET detects. Normal high uptake of FDG occurs in brain, liver, kidney, blad-\\nder, larynx, and lymphoid tissue of pharynx and must be considered when assess-\\ning images. Neoplasms  have high uptake of FDG with hotspots suggesting primary \\ndisease or metastases. Since inﬂ ammatory lesions will also show high uptake, there \\nis a risk of false-positive results (eg sarcoid, TB); diagnosis must be conﬁ rmed with \\nhistology of suspicious lesions. PET allows staging of many solid organ malignancies \\n(lung, melanoma, oesophageal) as well as lymphomas, and is particularly useful for \\nplanning of radiotherapy and surgery for both primary disease and metastases. PET \\ncan also be used to image occult sources of infection. PET can be combined with CT \\nor MRI to provide high-quality images combining anatomy with physiology. A range \\nof alternative tracers are now entering clinical use with radiotracers conjugated \\nto other tissue-speciﬁ c substrates (eg 11C-labelled metomidate to detect tumors of \\nadrenocortical origin, somatostatin tracers in neuroendocrine tumours, and amyloid \\ntracers in Alzheimer’s disease).\\nSingle photon emission computed tomography (SPECT) Similar to PET but rather \\nthan using positron emission, it uses a radioisotope-labelled molecule as per con-\\nventional nuclear imaging, but with two gamma cameras for detection. The images \\nproduced are of lower resolution than PET but the isotopes used are longer lived and \\nmore easily available.

Vascular CT: Has become \\nroutine in emergency assessment \\nof suspected dissections, ruptured \\naneurysms, and arterial and venous \\nthromboses ( ﬁ g 16.29). CT angiog-\\nraphy has overtaken invasive angi-\\nography in the assessment of many \\nconditions such as stable angina \\nand renal artery stenosis.\\nCatheter angiography Wherever intervention may be required, contrast studies \\nsuch as angiography provide both image clarity and the possibility of proceeding \\nto intervention, eg angioplasty or stenting of vessels, endovascular repair of an-\\neurysms, clipping/coiling of aneurysms (see p 746). Remember that these have a \\nhigh burden of both radiation and contrast medium, so check renal function before \\nrequesting. Complications  include those of arterial puncture (bleeding, infection, \\nthrombosis, dissection, pseudoaneurysm formation) plus cholesterol emboli, throm-\\nboemboli, and vasospasm.\\nMRI Cardiac MRI using ECG-gating to acquire the imaging data and relate it to the \\nposition in the cardiac cycle (best when the patient is in sinus rhythm) can reduce \\nmovement artefact and lead to excellent resolution images for functional assess-\\nment. This, coupled with a lack of radiation, makes it ideal for the assessment of \\na wide range of structural and functional heart diseases. Flow velocities can be \\nmeasured and, because the ﬂ ow is proportional to the pressure diff erences, degrees \\nof stenosis and regurgitation across heart valves can be calculated. Myocardial in-\\nfarction, perfusion, and viability can also be imaged with the use of IV gadolinium \\ncontrast (p748). Vascular MRI is used to limit radiation exposure where multiple \\ninvestigations may be required over a long time period, eg follow-up of intracranial \\naneurysm coiling, aortic root size in a young patient with Marfan’s syndrome (p706), \\nor Takayasu’s arteritis (p712).\\nUltrasound Non-invasive, relatively low cost, and with no radiation, US is excellent \\nfor assessing the heart and vasculature particularly in acute settings where the \\ntest can be performed at the bedside.

The use of exercise or pharma-\\ncological agents for ‘stress echocardiography’ can permit more detailed functional \\nassessment.

As well as assessing \\npotential malignant disease, MRCP is the imaging modality of choice for detection of \\ncommon bile duct stones that can be missed on US. MRI performed after ﬂ uid loading \\nof the small bowel (ﬂ  uid delivered orally=MRI enterography; ﬂ  uid delivered via nasodu-\\nodenal tube=MRI enteroclysis) permits assessment of small bowel inﬂ ammation (eg \\nCrohn’s) and lesions that can be challenging to reach with conventional endoscopy.\\nEndoscopic retrograde cholangiopancreatography ( ERCP; ﬁ g 16.33) Indica-\\ntions: No longer routinely used for diagnosis, it still has a signiﬁ  cant therapeutic \\nrole: sphincterotomy for common bile duct stones; stenting of benign or malignant \\nstrictures and obtaining brushings to diagnose the nature of a stricture. Method: \\nA cathet\\ner is advanced from a side-viewing duodenoscope via the ampulla into the \\ncommon bile duct. Contrast medium is injected and images taken to show lesions in \\nthe biliary tree and pancreatic ducts. Complications: Pancreatitis; bleeding; cholan-\\ngitis; perf\\noration. Mortality <0.2% overall; 0.4% if performing stone removal.\\nEndoscopic ultrasound (EUS; see p736.) Commonly used in diagnosis of upper GI \\nabnormalities, and is excellent for diagnosis of oesophageal, gastric, and pancreatic \\ncancers. It allows staging by assessing depth of invasion, as well as histological \\ndiagnosis by biopsy of lesions.\\nContrast studies (ﬁ g \\n16.34) These can help in dysphagia (p 250) and assessing \\nintegrity of anastomoses post-op. Real-time ﬂ  uoroscopic imaging studies assess \\nswallowing function. Barium gives better contrast but iodine-based water-soluble \\ncontrast medium is used if there is a concern of perforation. Contrast enemas are \\nincr\\neasingly obsolete and now used to exclude a leak following a low anterior resec-\\ntion, for proctograms, and not much else.\\n_OHCM_10e.indb   742_OHCM_10e.indb   742 02/05/2017   19:0802/05/2017   19:08'),\n",

Can be used to assess:\\nKidneys:\\n  • Renal size—small in chronic kidney disease, large in renal masses, cysts, hypertro-\\nphy if other kidney missing, polycystic kidney disease ( ﬁ g 16.35), and rarities (eg \\namyloidosis, p370).\\n  • Hydronephrosis, which may indicate ureteric obstruction or reﬂ ux (ﬁ g 13.49, p641).\\n  • Perinephric collections (trauma, post-biopsy).\\n  • Renal perfusion (assessment of renovascular disease: Doppler US of renal arteries).\\n  • Transplanted kidneys (collections, obstruction, perfusion).\\nLower urinary tract:\\n  • Bladder volume: useful in assessment of the need to catheterize (see p640) or for \\nassessment of adequacy of bladder emptying (post-micturition residual volume).\\n  • Prostate: transrectal ultrasound enables US-guided biopsy of focal lesions. NB: pros-\\ntate size does not correlate with symptoms.\\nOther:\\n  • Ovarian cysts, size, infections (pyosalpinx), uterine ﬁ  broids and other masses.\\n  • Testicular masses, hydrocele, varicocele.\\nAdvantages: Fast; cheap; independent of renal function; no IV contrast or radiation \\nrisk. Disadvantages: Intraluminal masses (transitional cell ca) in the upper tracts \\nma\\ny not be seen; not a functional study; only suggests obstruction if there is dilata-\\ntion of the collecting system (95% of obstructed kidneys) and so can miss obstruc-\\ntion from, eg retroperitoneal ﬁ brosis.\\nCT (ﬁ g 16.36) First choice in renal colic. Performed without intravenous contrast so \\nsafe in renal impairment; such unenhanced images miss <2% of stones, but can show \\nother pathologies. With IV contrast, CT can delineate masses (cystic or solid, contrast \\nenhancement, calciﬁ cation, local/distant extension, renal vein involvement); assess \\nrenal trauma (presence of two kidneys; haemorrhage; devascularization; laceration; \\nurine leak); and show retroperitoneal lesions. CT has all but replaced intravenous \\nurography and the radiation dose is similar.\\nPlain abdominal X-ray Can be used to look at the kidneys, the paths of the ureters, \\nand bladder\\n. However, in practice it is only useful for monitoring known renal calculi.\\nContrast studies Retrograde pyelography/ureterograms are good at showing \\npelvi-caly\\nceal, ureteric anatomy, and transitional cell carcinomas ( TCCS). Contrast \\nmedium is injected via a ureteric catheter. With the advent of cystoscopy, allowing \\nimmediate intervention, these are rarely done in isolation. H owever, contrast me-\\ndium is routinely used in cystoscopic placement of retrograde stents for obstruction.\\nPercutaneous nephrostomy. Used in obstruction to decompress the renal pelvis, \\nwhich is punctur\\ned under local anaesthetic with imaging guidance. Images are ob-\\ntained following contrast injection (antegrade pyelogram). A nephrostomy tube is \\nthen placed to allow decompression, sometimes followed by an antegrade stent if \\nthere is no easily treatable cause of obstruction.\\nRenal arteriography (ﬁ g \\n16.37) Therapeutic indications: angioplasty; stenting; em-\\nbolization (bleeding tumour, trauma, AV malformation).\\nMagnetic resonance imaging (MRI) Soft tissue resolution can help clarify equivo-\\ncal CT ﬁ ndings. Magnetic resonance angiography ( MRA) helps image renal artery \\nanatomy/stenosis (ﬁ g 16.38) and is also used in the assessment of potential live do-\\nnors for kidney transplant, as well as to monitor patients following embolization of \\ntumours, arteriovenous malformations, and aneurysms.\\nRadionuclide imaging See p\\n738.\\n_OHCM_10e.indb   744_OHCM_10e.indb   744 02/05/2017   19:0802/05/2017   19:08'),\n",

It is better than MRI at showing acute \\nhaemorrhage and fractures, and is much easier to do in ill or anaesthetized patients, \\nand so is good in emergencies. The attenuation of biological soft tissues is in a nar-\\nrow range from about +80 for blood and muscle, to 0 for CSF, and down to Ω100 \\nfor fat (Hounsﬁ  eld units, p730). IV contrast medium initially gives an angiographic \\neff ect, whitening the vessels. Later, if there is a defect in the blood –brain barrier \\n(eg tumours or infection), contrast medium will opacify a lesion’s margins, giving \\nenhancing white areas.\\n  • Some \\nCNS areas, eg pituitary gland, choroid plexus, have no blood –brain barrier \\nand enhance normally.\\n  • Fresh blood is of higher attenuation (ie whiter) than brain tissue.\\n  • In old haematomas, Hb breaks down and loses attenuation, so a subacute subdural \\nhaemat\\noma at 2wks may be of the same attenuation as adjacent brain.\\n  • A chronic subdural haematoma will be of relatively low attenuation.\\nCT is often used in acute stroke to exclude haemorrhage (eg pre-antiplatelets) and \\nwith perfusion scanning (ﬁ g 16.14) to aid management decisions regarding throm-\\nbolysis. The actual area of infarction/ischaemia may not show up for a day or so, and \\nwill be low-attenuation cytotoxic oedema (aff ecting both white and grey matter\\n—\\nlook for loss of grey matter deﬁ nition).\\nTumours and abscesses appear similar, eg a ring-enhancing mass, surrounding \\nv\\nasogenic oedema, and mass eff  ect. Vasogenic oedema (from leaky capillaries) is \\nextracellular and spreads through the white matter (grey matter spared). Mass ef-\\nfect causes compression of the sulci and ipsilateral ventricles, and may also cause \\nherniation (subfalcine, transtentorial, or tonsillar). \\ue007See p\\n483 (and also ﬁ g 16.40).\\nAnother indication for CT is acute, severe headache, eg suggestive of subarachnoid \\nhaemorrhage (p478). An unenhanced CT may show fresh blood, hydrocephalus or \\n\\ue000ICP, any of which could make LP unsafe.\\nCT angiography gives excellent mapping of the cerebral circulation ( ﬁ g 16.41), and \\ncan be done directly after unenhanced CT, looking for an aneurysm if the unenhanced \\nCT shows subarachnoid haemorrhage.\\nMRI (MRI in stroke: ﬁ g 10.19, p481) The chief image sequences are:\\n  • T1-weighted images: Give good anatomical detail to which the T2 image can be \\ncompared. Fat is brightest (\\ue000signal intensity); other tissues are darker to varying \\ndegrees. Flowing blood is low signal. Gadolinium contrast (p\\n748) usually results in \\nan increase in signal intensity. See  table 16.4.\\n  • T2-weighted images: These provide the best detection of most lesions as they usu-\\nally contain some oedema or ﬂ \\nuid and therefore appear white (eg ﬁ g 16.20, p735). \\nFat and ﬂ  uid appear brightest. Flowing blood is again low signal.\\nMagnetic resonance angiography maps carotid, vertebrobasilar, and cerebral ar-\\nt\\nerial circulations (and sinuses, veins). Functional MRI can image local blood ﬂ ow.\\nCatheter angiography (ﬁ g 16.42) Less commonly used since the advent of MRA and \\nCT angiography and perfusion techniques, though it has the advantage of allowing \\nimmediate therapy—eg coil embolization of saccular aneurysms.\\nRadionuclide imaging (p 738) PET is mostly used as a research tool in dementia, \\nbut perfusion scintigraphy scan be used in the assessment of Alzheimer’s disease, \\nother dementias, and localizing epileptogenic foci. \\nSPECT to visualize uptake of 123I-\\nFP-CIT (DaTSCAN™) can be used to assess reduced striatal dopaminergic transport in \\nParkinson’s disease.\\n_OHCM_10e.indb   746_OHCM_10e.indb   746 02/05/2017   19:0802/05/2017   19:08'),\n",

Contrast medium is usually admin-\\nistered by the following routes:\\n  •\\nPO: Barium- or iodine-based agents for, eg swallow or enhancing visualization of \\nbo\\nwel lumen on CT.\\n  • Inhaled: Technetium or xenon used in ventilation scintigraphy.\\n  • IV: (Most widespread clinical application.) Iodine or gadolinium.\\n  • PR: Air or CO2 can be introduced to the colon for CT colonography, iodinated con-\\ntrast medium is used for water-soluble enemas.\\nIodine-based contrast agents Iodine is used because of its relatively high elec-\\ntr\\non density and good physiological tolerance. When used with CT, the exami-\\nnation is said to be contrast enhanced —look for ‘ + c’ amongst the scan details. \\nExercise caution in:  renal or cardiac impairment; myeloma; diabetes; sickle cell \\ndisease; elderly; inf\\nants; the acutely unwell. \\ue007Avoid iodine-based agents in active \\nh\\nyperthyroidism.\\n\\ue007Have renal function to hand in these patients (see p 315). Minor reactions in-\\nclude nausea, v\\nomiting, and a sensation of warmth. More severe reactions in-\\nclude urticaria, bronchospasm, angioedema, and low BP (1:250); theoretical risk \\nof death for 1:150 000.\\n\\ue007Metformin should be withheld for 48h after IV contrast administration because \\nof the risk of lactic acidosis.\\nBarium sulfate Used in examination of the GI tract. Water-insoluble particles of \\n0.6–1.4μm diameter are mixed with large organic molecules such as pectin and \\ngum to promote good ﬂ  ow, mucosal adherence, and high density in thin layers. \\nComplications: Chemical pneumonitis or peritonitis. Never administer if you sus-\\npect perf\\norated viscus.\\nWater-soluble, non-ionic, iodine-based contrast agents  Used instead of \\nb\\narium where there is a risk of peritoneal contamination (eg ﬁ  stula, megacolon, \\nulceration, diverticulitis, bowel anastomosis, acute intestinal haemorrhage). Gas-\\ntrograffi   n should not be used.\\n\\ue007Contains iodine so establish allergy history and thyroid status.\\nAir In CT colonography, air (or CO 2) is insuffl  ated as a negative contrast medium \\nafter barium administration to enhance mucosal deﬁ  nition. Water can also be \\nused PO and PR to outline the lumen of the gut.\\nGadolinium A lanthanide series element with paramagnetic qualities that is ad-\\nminist\\nered intravenously (as gadolinium- DTPA) to enhance the contrast of certain \\nstructures in MRI. It works by reducing the time to relaxation ( TR) of hydrogen \\nnuclei in its proximity and appears as high signal on T1-weighted scans. It does \\nnot cross the blood –brain barrier so is useful in enhancing isointense extra-axial \\ntumours such as meningiomas. It can also highlight areas where the blood –brain \\nbarrier has broken down secondary to inﬂ  ammatory or neoplastic processes. It \\nis renally excreted: \\ue007check eGFR: if signiﬁ  cantly reduced, gadolinium is contrain-\\ndicated, as up to 30% may develop progressive nephrogenic systemic ﬁ  br osis/\\nnephrogenic ﬁ brosing dermopathy which causes generalized ﬁ  brosis which im-\\npairs movement and breathing —and which may be fatal. Aberrations in calcium-\\nphosphate metabolism and erythropoietin treatment seem to increase risk.

Further lack of evi-\\ndence to support Wagner’s hypothesis came \\nwhen Gauss’ brain was weighed: it would \\nperhaps have amused Gauss to learn that the \\nweight of his brain, whilst slightly above aver-\\nage, lay very much within the central region \\nof a Gaussian distribution. After some rather \\nsloppy housekeeping, Gauss’ brain was stored \\nin a mislabelled pot at the University in Göt-\\ntingen, accidentally switched with that of his \\ncontemporary, the physician Conrad Fuchs. \\nOver 150 years later, some careful searching \\nof the archives and a MRI scanner revealed \\nthe switch.\\n_OHCM_10e.indb   750_OHCM_10e.indb   750 02/05/2017   19:0802/05/2017   19:08'),\n",

This bell-shaped graph (ﬁ g 17.2) is the \\ntheoretical basis of reference intervals, and explains ‘lab error’ —why some tests \\nrepeated at close intervals may reveal slightly diff  erent values. Hb for example, \\nhas a lab error of ~5g/L. This emphasizes the importance of the clinical picture  in \\ndecision-making, rather than treating the numbers alone: don’t subject anaemic \\npatients to blood transfusions unless they have a clinical need. See p324.\\n  • Range is the lowest and highest value of all observations in the set being studied.\\n  • Arithmetic mean is the sum of all observations ÷ by the number of observations.\\n  • Median is the middle value (eg 9 data points are higher and 9 are lower). If their \\ndistribution is Normal, then the median coincides with the mean.\\n  • Standard deviation ( SD) is the square root of the variance (the average of the \\nsquare of the distance of each data point from the mean). When the distribution of \\nthe observations is Normal, 95% of observations are located in the interval ‘mean ± \\n1.96 SD’. This is the basis of the reference interval.\\n  • Standard error of the mean gives an estimate of the reliability of the mean of a \\nsample representing the mean of the population from which the sample was taken, \\nand is the SD of the sample ÷ by the square root of the number of observations \\nin the sample. Thus the larger the sample size, the smaller the standard error of \\nthe mean—the basis of ensuring that clinical trial evidence is based upon enough \\nobservations to be conﬁ dent that diff erences seen between groups do not occur \\nby chance alone.\\nFig 17.2 Normal (Gaussian) distribution curve.\\nReproduced from Bhopal, Concepts of Epidemiology , 2008, \\nwith permission from Oxford University Press.\\n_OHCM_10e.indb   751_OHCM_10e.indb   751 02/05/2017   19:0802/05/2017   19:08'),\n",

The explanation \\nremained elusive until Semmelweis’ friend Jakob Kolletschka died after receiving an \\naccidental scalpel cut from a student during a post-mortem demonstration. Sem-\\nmelweis recognized in Kolletschka’s death many of the features of the dying moth-\\ners. The explanation: the maternity ward doctors’ day started with post-mortem \\nexaminations, from which they would procede to perform vaginal examinations on \\nthe living without washing their hands. Noticing this, Semmelweis introduced the \\npractice of washing hands with chloride of lime and cut death rates to that of the \\nmidwives’ patients. Despite the evidence he amassed, Semmelweis’s theory was \\nrejected by his contemporaries, a rejection which undoubtedly contributed to his \\npsychiatric distress, eventual commitment to an asylum, and ultimate death from \\nthe blows of his guards. It would take another 20 years and countless deaths before \\nLister published his landmark work on the use of carbolic acid in surgery.\\nTake a minute to wash your hands thoroughly before undertaking any procedure. This \\nprerequisite will not only reduce infection risk for your patients, but give you a moment \\nfor mindfulness: focus on the hot water running over your hands, breathe deeply, and \\nfor a while forget about your list of jobs. Perhaps spare Dr Kolletschka a thought.

Large (eg 16F) are good for \\ndrainage but can be uncomfortable for patients. Small (eg 10F) are more comfort-\\nable for feeding but can be diffi  cult to aspirate and are poor for drainage. Used:\\n  • To decompress the stomach/gastrointestinal tract especially when there is ob-\\nstruction, eg gastric outﬂ \\now obstruction, ileus, intestinal obstruction.\\n  • For gastric lavage.\\n  • To administer feed/drugs, especially in critically ill patients or those with dys-\\nphagia, eg mo\\ntor neuron disease, post CVA.\\nPassing the tube Nurses are experts and will ask you (who may never have \\npassed one) t\\no do so only when they fail—so the ﬁ rst question to ask is: ‘Have you \\nasked the charge-nurse from the ward next door?’\\n  • Wear non-sterile gloves and an apron to protect both you and the patient.\\n  • Explain the procedure. Take a new, cool (hence less ﬂ  exible) tube. Have a cup of \\nwater to hand. Lubricate well with aqueous gel.\\n  • Use the tube, by holding it against the patient’s head, to estimate the length \\nr\\nequired to get from the nostril to the back of the throat.\\n  • Place lubricated tube in nostril with its natural curve promoting passage down, \\nr\\nather than up. The right nostril is often easier than the left but, if feasible, ask \\nthe patient for their preference. Advance directly backwards (not upwards).\\n  • When the tip is estimated to be entering the throat, rotate the tube by ~180° to \\ndiscourage passage into the mouth.\\n  • Ask the patient to swallow a sip of water, and advance as they do, timing each \\npush with a s\\nwallow. If this fails: Try the other nostril.\\n  • The tube has distance markings along it: the stomach is at ~35–40cm in adults, so \\nadvance > this distance, preferably 10 –20cm beyond. Tape securely to the nose.\\nConﬁ rming position This is vital prior to commencing any treatment through the \\ntube. Misplaced nasogastric tubes ha\\nve led to a number of preventable deaths, \\nand feeding via a misplaced tube is considered an NHS Never Event (a serious, \\nlargely preventable patient safety incident that should never occur if the available \\npreventative measures have been implemented).\\n  • Use pH paper to test that you are in the stomach: aspirated gastric contents are \\nacid (pH ≤\\n5.5) although antacids or PPIS may increase the pH. Small tubes can be \\ndiffi  cult to aspirate, try withdrawing or advancing a few cm or turning the patient \\non the left side to help dip the tube in gastric contents. Aspirates should be >0.5mL \\nand tested directly on unhandled pH paper. Allow 10s for colour change to occur.\\n  • If the pH is >5.5 and the NGT is needed for drug or feed administration then the \\nposition must be checked radiologically. Request a CXR/abdo X-ray (tell the radi-\\nologist why you need it). Look for the radio-opaque line/tip (this can be hard to \\nsee, look below the diaphragm, but if in doubt, ask for help from the radiologist).\\n  • The ‘whoosh’ t\\n est is NOT an accepted method of testing for tube position.\\n  • Either spigot the tube, or allow to drain into a dependent catheter bag secured \\nt\\no clothing (zinc oxide tape around tube to form a ﬂ ap, safety pin through ﬂ ap).\\n\\ue007Do not pass a tube nasally if there is any suspicion of a facial fracture.\\n\\ue007Get senior help if the patient has recently had upper GI surgery—it is not good \\npractice to push the tube through a fresh anastomosis.\\nComplications •Pain, or, rarely: •Loss of electrolytes •Oesophagitis •Tracheal or \\nduodenal intub\\nation •Necrosis: retro- or nasopharyngeal •Stomach perforation.\\nWeaning When planning removal of an NGT in situ for decompression or relief \\nof obstruction, it is wise to wean it so that the patient manages well without it. \\nDrainage should be <750mL/24 hours for successful weaning.\\n  • First it should be on free drainage with, eg, 4hrly aspirations.\\n  • Then spigot with 4hrly aspirations.\\n  • Then spigot only.

T he technique for placing a cannula is best shown at \\nthe bedside by an expert, but following these simple rules will signiﬁ cantly reduce \\nthe risk of infection from the cannula.\\nPreparation is key, remember the following before you start\\n1\\n      Equipment: Set up a tray with cleaning swabs, gauze, cannulae (swallow your \\npride and tak\\ne at least three of diff erent sizes, see table 18.1), dressings, 0.9% sa-\\nline, 10mL syringe, needle-free adaptor (eg octopus with bionector), blood tubes \\nif required, portable sharps bin \\ue003 needlestick injuries do happen.\\n2       P atient: Have them lying down, explain procedure, obtain verbal consent, place \\nt\\nourniquet around arm, rest the arm below the heart to aid venous ﬁ lling.\\n3       Sit e: Look for the best vein —it should be palpable; some of the best veins are not \\neasily visible, some of the most visible collapse on insertion. Tapping gently helps. \\n\\ue007Ne ver cannulate: AV ﬁ stulae arms, limbs with lymphoedema.  \\ue007A void: Sites \\ncr\\nossing a joint (if possible), the cephalic vein in a renal patient.\\n4       Consider: EMLA® cream, cold spray, or 1% lidocaine for children or those with \\nneedle phobia. EMLA® takes 45min to work, but can save you hassle later.\\nInsertion care bundle\\n1 Aseptic technique. 2 Hand hygiene. 3 Apron + non-sterile gloves. 4 Skin prepara-\\ntion—2% chorhexidine in 70% isopropyl alcohol (allow to dry for 30 seconds). Do not \\nrepalpate vein after cleaning unless wearing sterile gloves. 5 Dressing—sterile and \\ntransparent so that insertion site can be observed.\\nAfter insertion\\n1 Take blood with syringe or adaptor. 2 Remove tourniquet. 3 Attach needle-free de-\\nvice (if appr\\nopriate) and ﬂ ush with 10mL 0.9% saline. 4 Apply dressing. 5 Let nursing \\nstaff  know that cannula is in place and ready for use. 6 Document insertion according \\nto local policy. 7 Write up appropriate ﬂ uids or parenteral medication.\\nWhen seeing your patient on the daily ward round (and to avoid being called to \\nreview or replace cannulae at 6pm) do a RAID1 assessment: consider if the drip is:\\nRequired—can the patient manage with oral medication/ﬂ uids?\\nAppropriate—should you consider a PICC, central line, long-term line, etc?\\nInfected—any signs of inﬂ ammation or infection? Remove if yes. Peripheral cannulae \\nshould be replaced every 72–96 hours.\\nDressed properly—many drips are replaced early because they have ‘fallen out’, or \\nare kinked from poor dressings.\\nTissued or infected cannulae need replacing, either with another peripheral cannula, \\nor with a longer-term access device, such as a PICC line.\\nIf you fail after three attempts  \\ue007Shocked patients need ﬂ uid quickly: if you \\nare having trouble putting in a drip, call your senior. The following advice assumes \\nthat the drip is not immediately life-saving. \\n\\ue022If it is, see BOX.\\n  • Ask for help —from colleagues or seniors —do not be ashamed, everyone has to \\nlearn and even senior doctors have bad days; a fresh pair of eyes can be all it takes. \\nAs a house offi   cer, one of us was asked to place a drip when a very shame-faced \\nconsultant had ‘had a go’ to prove he still could, and found out that he couldn’t!\\n  • Help yourself\\n—try putting the hand in warm water, using a small amount of GTN \\npaste over the vein, or using ultrasound if available to help you identify the vein.\\n  • If there is no one else to help, take a break and come back in half an hour. Veins \\ncome and go, and coming b\\nack with fresh eyes can make all the diff erence.\\n_OHCM_10e.indb   760_OHCM_10e.indb   760 02/05/2017   19:0902/05/2017   19:09'),\n",

There may be no one else available to help when there is an \\nabsolute and urgent indication for \\nIV drugs/ﬂ uids/blood—and all of the previously \\ndiscussed measures have been tried, and have failed. Think of lonesome night \\nshifts, over-run emergency departments, a disaster scene, war, or medicine in \\nthe ﬁ eld. The following measures are not recommended for non-life-threatening \\nscenarios:\\n \\ue022Don’t worry. Have a good look again. Feet (avoid in diabetics)? Inside of the \\nforearm? Upper arm?\\n \\ue022Have you really exhausted all of your options for help from a colleague? Maybe \\nthe anaesthetist or \\nICU registrar is approachable—they do have remarkable skills.\\n \\ue022Is the patient familiar with his/her own veins (eg previous IV drug abuser)?\\n \\ue022If there is only a small amount of IV medication required and a small, short vein, \\nyou may be able to gain access with a carefully placed butterﬂ y needle that is \\ntaped down. Some drugs cannot be passed this way (eg amiodarone, K+).\\n \\ue022The external jugular vein may become prominent when the patient is head down \\n(Trendelenburg) by \\n5–10° (\\ue007not in situations of ﬂ uid overload, LVF, \\ue000ICP). Only at-\\ntempt cannulation of this vein if you are not going to jeopardize future central \\nline insertion, and if you can clearly determine the surrounding anatomy.\\n \\ue022In an arrest situation, the 2015 Advanced Life Support Guidelines recommend \\nthe intraosseous route in both adults and children if venous access is not pos-\\nsible; access devices should be available within resuscitation settings (eg emer-\\ngency department).\\nOnly do the following if you have had the appropriate training/experience:\\n \\ue022In children, consider cannulating a scalp vein.\\n \\ue022Central venous catheterization (p775).

Think, does the patient really need a \\ncatheter? If so, use the smallest you can and take out as soon as possible.\\nSize (in French gauge): \\n12=small; 16=large; 20=very large (eg 3-way). Material Coat-\\ned lat\\nex catheters are soft and a good short-term option \\ue007but unsuitable in true \\nlat\\nex allergy. Silastic (silicone) catheters may be used long term, but cost more. Sil-\\nver alloy coating reduces infections. Shape Foley is typical (ﬁ g 18.2); coudé (elbow) \\ncatheters have an angled tip to ease around prostates but are more risky; 3-way \\ncatheters are used in clot or debris retention and have an extra lumen for irrigation \\nﬂ uid, attached to the irrigation set via an extra port on the distal end (ﬁ g 18.3). Get \\nurology advice before starting irrigation. Condom catheters are often preferred by \\npatients (less discomfort) even though they may leak and fall off .\\nCatheter problems • Inf\\n ection: ~5% develop bacteraemia (most will have bacte-\\nrial colonization, antibiotics may not be required unless systemically unwell—discuss \\nwith microbiology). A stat dose of, eg gentamicin 80mg is sometimes given pre-\\ninsertion despite a lack of evidence for beneﬁ t. Check your local policy. • Bladder  \\nspasm: May be painful—try reducing the water in the balloon or an anticholinergic \\ndrug, eg oxybutynin.\\nPer urethram Aseptic technique required.\\nIndications • Relieve urinary retention. • Monitor urine output in critically ill pa-\\ntients. • Collect uncontaminated urine for diagnosis. \\ue007 It is contraindicated in ure-\\nthr\\nal injury (eg pelvic fracture) and acute prostatitis.\\n  • Explain the procedure, and obtain verbal consent. Prepare a catheterization trolley: \\nglo\\nves, catheter, lidocaine jelly, cleaning solution, drape, kidney dish, gauze swabs, \\ndrainage bag, 10mL water and syringe, specimen container.\\n  • Lie the patient supine: women with knees ﬂ  exed and hips abducted with heels to-\\ngether. Use a gloved hand to clean urethral meatus in a pubis-to-anus direction, hold-\\ning the labia apart with the other hand. With uncircumcised men, retract the foreskin \\nto clean the glans; use a gloved hand to hold the penis still. The hand used to hold \\nthe penis or labia should not touch the catheter. Place a sterile drape with a hole in \\nthe middle to help you maintain asepsis. Remember: left hand dirty, right hand clean.\\n  • Put sterile lidocaine \\n1–2% gel on the catheter tip and ≤10mL into the urethra (≤5mL \\nif \\ue033). In men, lift and gently stretch the penis upwards to eliminate any urethral \\nfolds that may lead to false passage formation.\\n  • Use steady gentle pressure to advance the catheter, rotating slightly can help it \\nslide in. \\ue007Never force the catheter. Tilting the penis up towards the umbilicus while \\ninserting ma\\ny help negotiate the prostate. Insert to the hilt; wait until urine emerg-\\nes before inﬂ ating the balloon. Remember to check the balloon’s capacity before in-\\nﬂ ation (written on the outer end). Collect a sterile specimen and attach a drainage \\nbag. Pull the catheter back so that the balloon comes to rest at the bladder neck.\\n  • If you are having trouble getting past the prostate, try: more lubrication, a gentle \\nt\\nwisting motion; a larger catheter; or call the urologists, who may use a guidewire.\\n\\ue007Remember to reposition the foreskin in uncircumcised men after the catheter is \\ninsert\\ned to prevent oedema of the glans and paraphimos.\\nDocumentation: In the notes be sure to document the indication for catheterization, \\nsiz\\ne of catheter, whether insertion was diffi  cult or straightforward, any complica-\\ntions, residual volume and colour of urine. It is good practice to document that the \\nforeskin has been replaced. Sign with your name, date, and designation.\\nSuprapubic catheterization: Sterile technique required \\ue007Absolutely contraindi-\\ncat\\ned unless there is a large bladder palpable or visible on ultrasound, because of the \\nrisk of bowel perforation. Be wary, particularly if there is a history of abdominal or \\npelvic surgery.

Never \\nconsider a patient in diffi  culties from a big residual volume to be too old, young, \\nor disabled to learn. 5-yr-old children can learn the technique, and can have their \\nlives transformed—so motivation may be excellent. There may be fewer UTIs as \\nthere is no residual urine —and less reﬂ ux obstructive uropathy. Assessing suit-\\nability entails testing sacral dermatomes: a ‘numb bum’ implies \\ue001sensation of a \\nfull bladder; higher sensory loss may mean catheterization will be painless. Get \\nhelp from your continence adviser who will be in a position to teach the patient \\nor carer that catheterizations must be gentle (the catheter is of a much smaller \\ncalibre), particularly if sensation is lacking, and must number >4/d (‘always keep \\nyour catheter with you; don’t wait for an urge before catheterizing’). See ﬁ g 18.4.\\nSelf-catheterization\\nYou will be asked to check catheters that are not draining. Check the ﬂ uid chart \\nand the patient:\\n  • Previously good output, now anuric:  Blocked catheter until proven otherwise. \\nWas the urine clear previously or bloodstained? Consider ﬂ ushing the catheter: \\nwith aseptic technique ﬂ  ush and withdraw 20mL of sterile 0.9% saline with a \\nbladder syringe. This may get the ﬂ ow going again. A 3-way catheter may be \\nneeded if there is clot or debris retention. If it blocks again, replace it. Repeated \\nﬂ ushes lead to infection.\\n  •  Slow decline in urine output over several hours:  In a dehydrated/post-op pa-\\ntient a ﬂ  uid challenge of 500mL STAT (250mL if cardiac comorbidity) may help, \\ncome back and check the response in 30min. Check all other parameters (eg \\npulse, BP, CVP) and increase rate of background IV ﬂ uids if appropriate.\\n\\ue022Acute kidney injury (p298): if urine output has tailed off  and now stopped, the \\ncause is often renal hypoperfusion (ie pre-renal failure), but consider other fac-\\ntors, eg nephrotoxic drugs.\\n  •  Catheter is bypassing:  A condom catheter may be more appropriate.\\n  •  Catheter has dislodged into the proximal (prostatic) urethra:  Possible even \\nif the balloon is fully inﬂ ated. Consider this if a ﬂ ush enters but cannot be with-\\ndrawn. If the patient still needs a catheter then replace it, consider a larger size.\\n  • The catheter has perforated the lower urinary tract on insertion and is not \\nlying in the bladder or urethra: \\ue022If suspected, call the urologists immediately.\\nRemember: urine output should be >400mL in 24h or >0.5mL/kg/h (see p576).\\n‘The catheter is not draining…’\\nWhen it is time to remove a catheter, the possibility of urinary retention must be \\nconsidered. Remove the catheter ﬁ rst thing one morning. If retention does occur, \\ninsert a long-term catheter (eg silicone), consider an \\ue025-blocker (p642), and arrange \\nurology TWOC clinic follow-up. \\nTrial without catheter (TWOC)\\nFig 18.2 A size 14F latex Foley \\ncatheter with the balloon inf-\\nl ated via the topmost port of \\nthe outer end (green).\\n© Dr Tom Turmezei (not to scale).\\nFig 18.3  The external end of \\na size 20F 3-way catheter.

Paracentesis in such patients even in \\nthe presence of spontaneous bacterial peritonitis may be safe. Learn at the bedside \\nfrom an expert.\\nContraindications (these are relative, not absolute)  End-stage cirrhosis; co-\\nagulopath\\ny; hyponatraemia ( \\ue005126mmol/L); sepsis. The main complication of the \\nprocedure is severe hypovolaemia secondary to reaccumulation of the ascites, so \\nintravascular replenishment with a plasma expander is required. For smaller vol-\\numes, eg less than \\n5L, 500mL of 5% human albumin or Gelofusine® would be suf-\\nﬁ cient. For volumes over 5L, reasonable replacement would be 100mL 20% human \\nalbumin IV for each 1–3 litres of ascites drained (check your local policy). You may \\nneed to call the haematology lab to request this in advance.\\nProcedure Requires sterile technique.\\n  • Ensure you have good IV access—eg 18G cannula in the antecubital fossa.\\n  • Explain the procedure including the risks of infection, bleeding, hyponatraemia, \\nr\\nenal impairment, and damage to surrounding structures (such as liver, spleen, \\nand bowel), and obtain consent from the patient. Serious complications occur in \\nless than \\n1 in 1000 patients. Ask the patient to empty their bladder.\\n  • Examine the abdomen carefully, evaluating the ascites and checking for orga-\\nnomegaly\\n. Mark where you are going to enter. If in doubt, ask the radiology de-\\npartment to ultrasound the abdomen and mark a spot for drainage. Approach \\nfrom the left side unless previous local surgery/stoma prevents this\\n—call a senior \\nfor support and advice if this is the case.\\n  • Prepare a tray with 2% chlorhexidine solution, sterile drapes, 1% lidocaine, sy-\\nringes, needles, sample bottles, and your drain. Clean the abdomen thoroughly \\nand place sterile drapes, ensure you maintain sterile technique throughout. Inﬁ l-\\ntrate the local anaesthetic.\\n  • Perform an ascitic tap (see p\\n765) ﬁ rst so that you know you are in the correct \\nplace: remove 20mL ﬂ uid for MC&S.\\n  • Away from the patient, carefully thread the catheter over the (large and long) \\nneedle using the guide so that the pig-tail has been str\\naightened out. Remove \\nthe guide.\\n  • With the left hand hold the needle ~ 2.5cm (1 inch) from the tip —this will stop it \\nfrom advancing too far (and from performing an aortic biopsy). With the right \\nhand, hold the other end.\\n  • Gently insert the needle perpendicular to the skin at the site of the ascitic tap up \\nt\\no your hold with your left hand —ascites should now drain easily. If necessary, \\nadvance the needle and catheter a short distance until good ﬂ ow is achieved.\\n  • Advance the catheter over the needle with your left hand, keeping the needle in \\ne\\nxactly the same place with your right hand. \\ue007Do not re-advance the needle be-\\ncause it will go thr\\nough the curled pig-tail and do not withdraw it because you \\nwon’t be able to thread in the catheter.\\n  • When fully inserted, remove the needle, connect the catheter to a drainage bag \\n(k\\neep it below the level of the abdomen), and tape it down securely to the skin.\\n  • The patient should stay in bed as the ascites drains.\\n  • Document clearly in the notes the indication for the procedure, that consent was \\nob\\ntained, clotting and U&ES checked pre-procedure, how much lidocaine was re-\\nquired, how much ﬂ uid was removed for investigations, and whether there were \\nany complications to the procedure.\\n  • Replenish intravascular volume with human albumin (see ‘Contraindications’ ear-\\nlier in t\\nopic).\\n  • Ask the nursing staff  t o remove the catheter after 6h or after a pre-determined \\nvolume has been drained (up to 20L can come off  in 6h) and document this clear-\\nly in the medical notes. Drains are removed after 4–6h to prevent infection.\\n  • Check U&ES after the procedure and re-examine the patient.\\n_OHCM_10e.indb   764_OHCM_10e.indb   764 02/05/2017   19:0902/05/2017   19:09'),\n",

Whatever ﬂ uid you \\nare sampling, a green needle carries far less risk \\nthan a formal drain. It also allows you to decide \\nwhether a drain is required.\\nAscites may be sampled to give a cytological \\nor bacterial diagnosis, eg to exclude spontaneous \\nbacterial peritonitis (SBP; p276). Before starting, \\nknow the patient’s platelets + clotting times. If \\nthey are abnormal, seek help before proceeding.\\n  • Place the patient ﬂ  at and tap out the ascites, \\nmarking a point where ﬂ  uid has been identiﬁ ed, \\navoiding vessels, stomas, and scars (adhesions to \\nthe anterior abdominal wall). The left side may \\nbe safer—less chance of nicking liver (ﬁ g 18.5).\\n  • Clean the skin. Inﬁ  ltrate some local anaes-\\nthetic, eg 1% lidocaine (see p573).\\n  • Insert a 21G needle on a 20mL syringe into the \\nskin and advance while aspirating until ﬂ uid is \\nwithdrawn, try to obtain 60mL of ﬂ uid.\\n  • Remove the needle, apply a sterile dressing.\\n  • Send ﬂ uid to microbiology ( 15mL) for microscopy and culture, biochemistry \\n(5mL for protein, see p192), and cytology (40mL). Call microbiology to forewarn \\nthem if urgent analysis of the specimen is required.\\nDiagnostic aspiration of a pleural eff usion\\n  • If not yet done, a CXR may help evaluate the side and size of the eff usion.\\n  • Ideally use US guidance at the bedside ( \\ue000 chance of successful aspirate and \\ue001 \\nchance of organ puncture). If this is unavailable, ask an ultrasonographer to \\nmark a spot, or percuss the upper border of the pleural eff  usion and choose a site \\n1 or 2 intercostal spaces below it (usually posteriorly or laterally).\\n  • Clean the area around the marked spot with 2% chlorhexidine solution.\\n  • Inﬁ ltrate down to the pleura with 5–10mL of 1% lidocaine.\\n  • Attach a 21G needle to a syringe and insert it just above the upper border of the \\nrib below the mark to avoid the neurovascular bundle (ﬁ g 18.6). Aspirate whilst \\nadvancing the needle. Draw off  10–30mL of pleural ﬂ  uid. Send ﬂ  uid to the lab \\nfor chemistry (protein, glucose, pH, LDH); bacteriology (microscopy and culture, \\nauramine stain, TB culture); cytology, and, if indicated, amylase and immunology \\n(rheumatoid factor, antinuclear antibodies, complement).\\n\\ue022If you cannot obtain ﬂ  uid with a 21G needle, seek help.\\n  • If any cause for concern, arrange a repeat CXR.\\nDiagnostic taps\\nFig 18.5 Always tap out the ascites, \\nbut aim approximately for 5cm me-\\ndial to and superior to the anterior \\nsuperior iliac spine.

This technique is also used for pneumathoraces (except in traumatic or \\npost-operative situations) without US guidance; for this reason it is detailed here.\\nSterile procedure\\n  • Identify the point for drainage. In eff  usions, this should be done with US, ideally \\nunder direct guidance or with a marked spot. For pneumothoraces, check the \\ndrainage point from \\nCXR/CT/examination.\\n  • Preparation: trolley with dressing pack; 2% chlorhexidine; needles; 10mL syring-\\nes; 1% lidocaine; scalpel; suture; Seldinger chest drain kit; underwater drainage \\nbottle; connection tubes; sterile H2O; dressings. Incontinence pad under patient.\\n  • Choose insertion site: 4–6th intercostal space, anterior- to mid-axillary line —the \\n‘safe triangle’ (see BOX ‘The “safe triangle” for insertion’ and ﬁ g 18.7). A more pos-\\nterior approach, eg the 7th space posteriorly, may be required to drain a locu-\\nlated eff usion (under direct US visualization) and occasionally the 2nd intercostal \\nspace in the mid-clavicular line may be used for apical pneumothoraces —how-\\never, both approaches tend to be less comfortable.\\n  • Maintain sterile technique—clean and place sterile drapes. Scrub for insertion.\\n  • Prepare your underwater drain by ﬁ lling the bottle to the marked line with ster-\\nile water. Ensure this is kept sterile until you need it.\\n  • Inﬁ ltrate down to pleura with 10mL of 1% lidocaine and a 21G needle. Check that \\nair/ﬂ uid can be aspirated from the proposed insertion site; if not, do not proceed.\\n  • Attach the Seldinger needle to the syringe containing 1–2mL of sterile saline. The \\nneedle is bevelled and will direct the guidewire; in general advance bevel up for \\npneumothoraces, bevel down for eff usions.\\n  • Insert the needle gently, aspirating constantly. When ﬂ \\n uid/air is obtained in the \\nsyringe, stop, note insertion depth from the markings on the Seldinger needle. \\nRemove syringe, thread the guidewire through the needle. Remove the needle \\nand clamp the guidewire to the sterile drapes to ensure it does not move. Using \\nthe markings on the Seldinger needle, move the rubber stops on the dilators to \\nthe depth noted earlier, to prevent the dilator slipping in further than intended.\\n  • Make a nick in the skin where the wire enters, and slide the dilators over the wire \\nsequentially fr\\nom smallest to largest to enlarge the hole, keep gauze on hand. Slide \\nthe Seldinger drain over the wire into the pleural cavity. Remove the wire and \\nattach a \\n3-way tap to the drain, then connect to the underwater drainage bottle.\\n  • Suture the drain in place using a drain stitch—make a stitch in the skin close to the \\ndrain site, tie this fairly loosely with a double knot. Then tie the suture to the drain. \\nIt is usually best to be shown this before attempting it for yourself. Dress the drain, \\nand ensure it is well taped down.\\n  • Check that the drain is swinging (eff \\n usion) or bubbling (pneumothorax) and ensure \\nthe water bottle remains below the level of the patient at all times. If the drain \\nneeds to be lifted above the patient, clamp it brieﬂ  y. \\ue007You should never clamp \\nchest dr\\nains inserted for pneumothoraces. Clamping for pleural eff  usions can con-\\ntrol the rate of drainage and prevent expansion pulmonary oedema. \\n  • Request a CXR to check the position of the drain.\\nRemoval In pneumo thorax: Consider when drain is no longer bubbling and CXR \\nshows re-inﬂ ation. Give analgesia beforehand, eg morphine. Smartly withdraw dur-\\ning expiration or Valsalva. There is no need to clamp the drain beforehand as reinser-\\ntion is unlikely. In effusions: Generally the drain can be removed when drainage is \\n<200mL/24h, but for cirrhotic hydrothoraces the chest drain is treated similarly to \\nthe ascitic drain (see p764) with HAS supplementation and removal at 4–6 hours.\\n_OHCM_10e.indb   766_OHCM_10e.indb   766 02/05/2017   19:0902/05/2017   19:09'),\n",

Remove the stylet, allowing the trapped air to es-\\ncape, usually with an audible hiss. This converts the tension pneumothorax to an open \\npneumothorax. Tape securely. • Don’t recover the cannula as tensioning will recur.\\n  • Proceed to formal chest drain insertion (see p766).\\nRelieving a tension pneumothorax\\nIdentify the 2nd intercostal space in the midclavicular line (or 4–6th intercostal \\nspace in the midaxillary line) and inﬁ ltrate with 1% lidocaine down to the pleura \\noverlying the pneumothorax.\\n  • Insert a 16G cannula into the pleural space. Remove the needle and connect the \\n cannula to a 3-way tap and a 50mL syringe. Aspirate up to 2.5L of air (50mL≈50). \\nStop if resistance is felt, or if the patient coughs excessively.\\n  • Request a CXR to conﬁ  rm resolution of the pneumothorax. If successful, consider \\ndischarging the patient and repeating the CXR after 24h to exclude recurrence, \\nand again after 7–10d.

To estimate the true protein level, subtract \\n10mg/L for every 1000 RBCS/mm3 (be sure to do the count and protein estimation on \\nthe same bottle). NB: high protein levels in CSF make it appear yellow. Subarachnoid \\nhaemorrhage: Xanthochromia (yellow supernatant on spun CSF). Red cells in equal \\nnumbers in all bottles (unreliable).

This may be done as an emergency, \\neg VF/VT, or electively, eg AF.\\nAim To completely depolarize the heart using a direct \\ncurrent.\\nProcedure \\ue022For VF/pulseless VT follow the  ALS algo-\\nrithm on p 894 and call the arrest team!\\n  • Unless critically unwell, conscious patients require a \\ngeneral anaesthetic or monitored heavy sedation.\\n  • If elective cardioversion of AF ensure adequate antico-\\nagulation beforehand.\\n  • Almost all deﬁ brillators are now paddle-free and use \\n‘hands-free’ pads instead (less chance of skin arc than \\njelly). Place the pads on chest, one over apex (p39) and \\none below right clavicle. The positions are often given \\nby a diagram on the reverse of the pad.\\nCardioversion:  Synchronize the shock with the rhythm \\nby pressing the ‘SYNC’ button on the machine. This en-\\nsures the shock does not initiate a ventricular arrhyth-\\nmia. However, this only works for cardioversion; if the \\nsync mode is engaged in VF, the deﬁ brillator will not \\ndischarge.\\n  • Monophasic deﬁ brillat ors: (ﬁ g 18.10) Set the energy \\nlevel at 360J for VF/VT (\\ue022arrest situation); 200J for AF; 50J for atrial ﬂ utter.\\n  • Biphasic deﬁ brillat ors: (ﬁ g 18.11) Impedance is less with a biphasic shock and \\n120–200J is used for shocks for VF/VT. They use less energy and are just as eff ective \\nas monophasic deﬁ bs in cardio version. 120–200J will cardiovert most arrhythmias.\\n  • Automatic external deﬁ brillators: (AEDS) Can be used by anyone who can turn \\nthem on and apply the pads. Follow the instructions given by the AED.\\nShocking\\n1      Consider anticoagulation in AF (see p130).\\n2       Clearly state that you are charging the deﬁ brillator.\\n3       Make sure no one else is touching the patient, the bed, or anything is in turn \\ntouching these.\\n4       Clearly state that you are about to shock the patient.\\n5       Give the shock. If there is a change in rhythm before you shock and the shock \\nis no longer r equired, turn the dial to ‘discharge’. Do not allow anyone to ap-\\nproach until the reading has dropped to 0J.\\n6       After a shock: \\ue022in resuscitation, resume CPR immediately and do not reassess \\nrhythm until the end of the cycle (see p 894, ﬁ g A3); in cardioversion, watch \\nECG; consider need to repeat the shock.

The usual site is \\nthe radial artery at the wrist. \\n\\ue007Check with the patient that \\nthey do not have an arterio-\\nvenous ﬁ stula for haemodial-\\nysis. Never, ever sample from \\na ﬁ stula.\\nProcedure:\\n  • Get kit ready; include: port-\\nable sharps bin; pre-heparin-\\nized syringe; needle (blue size \\n(23G) is good, although many \\nsyringes now come pre-made with needle); gloves; 2% chlorhexidine/70% alco-\\nhol swab; gauze; tape.\\n  • Feel thoroughly for the best site. Look at both sides.\\n  • Wipe with cleaning swab. Let the area dry. Get yourself comfortable.\\n  • If the patient is drowsy or unconscious, ask an assistant to hold the hand and \\narm with the wrist slightly extended (ﬁ g 18.12).\\n  • Before sampling, expel any excess heparin in the syringe. Inﬁ ltration over the \\nartery with a small amount of 1% lidocaine (p573) through a 25G (orange) needle \\nmakes the procedure painless.\\n  • Hold the syringe like a pen, with the needle bevel up. Let the patient know you \\nare about to take the sample. Feel for the pulse with your other hand and enter \\nat 45°, aiming beneath the ﬁ nger you are feeling with.\\n  • In most syringes, the plunger will move up on its own in a pulsatile manner if \\nyou are in the artery; rarely, entry into a vein next to the artery will give a similar \\nresult. Colour of the blood is little guide to its source.\\n  • Allow the syringe to ﬁ  ll with \\n1–2mL, then remove the needle \\nand apply ﬁ  rm pressure for 5 \\nminutes (10 if anticoagulated).\\n  • Expel any air from the syringe \\nas this will alt er the oxygen-\\nation of the blood. Cap and \\nlabel the sample, check the \\npatient’s temperature and FiO2 \\n(0.21 if on air). Take the sample \\nto the nearest analysis ma-\\nchine or send it by express de-\\nlivery to the lab (which may be \\nby your own feet, get someone \\nelse to apply pressure) as it should be analysed within 15 minutes of sampling.\\n  • Syringes and analysis machines diff er, so get familiar with the local nuances.\\nThe other site that is amenable to ABG sampling is the femoral artery (ﬁ g 18.13). \\nSurprisingly this may be less uncomfortable as it is a relatively less sensitive area \\nand because, when supine, the patient cannot see the needle and thus may feel less \\napprehensive. The brachial artery can also be used, but be aware that the median \\nnerve sits closely on its medial side and it is an end-artery. Normal values: p753.\\nTaking arterial blood gas (ABG) samples\\nFig 18.12 The ideal position for the wrist, slightly hyperex-\\ntended, resting on an unopened litre bag of ﬂ  uid or a band-\\nage is ideal.

It should only be done in absolute ‘can’t intubate, \\ncan’t ventilate’ situations, ie where ventilation is impossible with a bag and mask (± \\nairway adjuncts) and where there is an immediate threat to life. If not, call anaes-\\nthetics or ENT for immediate help.\\nIndications Upper airway obstruction when endotracheal intubation not possible, \\neg irretrievable foreign body; facial oedema (burns, angio-oedema); maxillofacial \\ntrauma; infection (epiglottitis).\\nProcedure Lie the patient supine with neck extended (eg pillow under shoulders) \\nunless there is suspected cervical-spine instability. Run your index ﬁ  nger down the \\nneck anteriorly in the midline to ﬁ  nd the notch in the upper border of the thyroid \\ncartilage (the Adam’s apple): just below this, between the thyroid and cricoid carti-\\nlages, is a depression—the cricothyroid membrane (see ﬁ g 18.14). If you cannot feel \\nthe depression and it is an emergency, \\nyou can access the trachea directly ap-\\nproximately halfway between the cricoid \\ncartilage and the suprasternal notch.\\nIdeally use a purpose-designed kit\\n(eg QuickTrach ∏, MiniTrach ∏), all hos-\\npitals will stock one version. If no kit is \\navailable then a cannula (needle crico-\\nthyroidotomy) can buy time, and in out-\\nof-hospital situations a blade and empty \\nbiro case have saved lives. \\ue022Needle and \\nkit cricothyroidotomies are temporary \\nmeasures pending formal tracheostomy.\\n1 Needle cricothyroidotomy:  Pierce the membrane perpendicular to the skin with \\nlarge-bore cannula (14G) attached to syringe: withdrawal of air conﬁ rms position; \\nlidocaine may or may not be required. Slide cannula over needle at 45° to the skin \\nsuperiorly in the sagittal plane. Use a Y-connector (see ﬁ g 18.16) or improvise con-\\nnection to O2 supply at 15L/min: use thumb on Y-connector to allow O 2 in over 1s \\nand CO2 out over 4s (‘transtracheal jet insuffl   ation’). This is the preferred method in \\nchildren <12yrs. This will only sustain life for 30–45min before CO2 builds up. However, \\nif the patient has a completely obstructed airway then they will not be able to exhale \\nthrough this, and it will lead to cardiovascular compromise and pneumothoraces.\\n2 Cricothyroidotomy kit: Most contain a guarded blade, and a large ( 4–6mm) \\nshaped cannula (cuff ed or uncuff  ed depending on brand) over an introducer, plus \\na connector and binding tape. The patient will have to be ventilated via a bag, as \\nthe resistance is too high to breathe spontaneously. This will sustain for 30–45min.\\n3 Surgical cricothyroidotomy:  Smallest tube for prolonged ventilation is 6mm. \\nIntroduce high-volume, low-pressure cuff  tracheostomy tube through a horizontal \\nincision in membrane. Take care not to cut the thyroid or cricoid cartilages.\\nComplications Local haemorrhage ± aspiration; posterior perforation of trachea \\n± oesophagus; subglottic stenosis; laryngeal stenosis if membrane over-incised in \\nchildhood; tube blockage; subcutaneous tunnelling; vocal cord paralysis or hoarse-\\nness (the recurrent laryngeal nerve runs superiorly in the tracheo-oesophageal \\ngroove).\\nFig 18.14 The cricothyroid membrane.\\n_OHCM_10e.indb   772_OHCM_10e.indb   772 02/05/2017   19:0902/05/2017   19:09'),\n",

The choice depends largely on operator experi-\\nence, but evidence suggests that the femoral approach is associated with a higher \\nrate of line infection and thrombosis. Overall, the internal jugular approach (with \\nultrasound guidance) is most commonly used and risks fewer complications than \\nthe subclavian. If possible, get written consent (p\\n568).

They are placed using \\na Seldinger technique, puncturing the brachial or basilic vein then threading the \\nline into the subclavian or superior vena cava. Because of the insertion site there \\nis a much lower risk of pneumo- or haemothorax, but they are tricky to insert in an \\nemergency.\\nRemoving central lines Should be done carefully with aseptic technique.

If \\nyou are screening, wear a protective lead apron.\\n  • Inser\\ntion: Using an aseptic technique, place the introducer into the (ideally right) \\nint\\nernal jugular vein (p 775) or subclavian. If this is diffi   cult, access to the right \\natrium can be achieved via the femoral vein. Pass the pacing wire through the \\nintroducer into the right atrium, ideally under radiological screening. It will either \\npass easily through the tricuspid valve or loop within the atrium. If the latter oc-\\ncurs, it is usually possible to ﬂ  ip the wire across the valve with a combined twisting \\nand withdrawing movement (ﬁ g \\n18.19). Advance the wire slightly. At this stage the \\nwire may try to exit the ventricle through the pulmonary outﬂ  ow tract. A further \\nwithdrawing and rotation of the wire will aim the tip at the apex of the right ven-\\ntricle. Advance slightly again to place the wire in contact with the endocardium. \\nRemove any slack to \\ue001risk of subsequent displacement.\\n  • Checking the thr\\n eshold: Connect the wire to the pacing box and set the ‘demand’ \\nr\\nate slightly higher than the patient’s own heart rate and the output to 3V. A paced \\nrhythm should be seen. Find the pacing threshold by slowly reducing the voltage \\nuntil the pacemaker fails to stimulate the tissue (pacing spikes are no longer fol-\\nlowed by paced beats). The threshold should be less than \\n1V, but a slightly higher \\nvalue may be acceptable if it is stable—eg after a large infarction.\\n  • Se tting the pacemaker:  Set the output to 3V or over 3 times the threshold value \\n(whichever is higher) in ‘demand’ mode. Set the rate as required. Suture the wire to \\nthe skin, and ﬁ x with a sterile dressing.\\n  • Check the position of the wire (and exclude pneumothorax) with a \\nCXR.\\n  • Recurrent checks of the pacing threshold are required over the next few days.

Some fear the emergency take, worried as \\nto what they will miss, how many will die. There is no right approach; the emer-\\ngency room needs both thought and practicality to manage patients. A patient \\nwho comes in ﬂ at and can be resuscitated gives the whole team a boost, as right \\nthere in front of us is the proof that we can make a diff erence. However, a patient \\nwho comes in well and collapses, dying before we can even decide what is wrong, \\ncan bring the whole team down. There are nights where we save life after life, and \\nnights where we can’t; sometimes a death is inevitable, despite our best eff orts. \\nYou are a doctor, but you are a human being as well, and losing a patient can feel \\nlike a personal failure. However, remember that when we lose a patient it is the \\ndisease that has killed them, not us. Try to take a few minutes and reﬂ ect on what \\nhappened; ask if you could have done anything diff  erently. Should you have sought \\nhelp sooner? Discussing with a senior can be helpful, as can writing down your \\nreﬂ ection, not in a portfolio for discussion at your appraisal, but in anonymous for-\\nmat for your own education. Watch the team at an arrest, the best leaders are the \\nones who have learned to stand back, assess the whole situation, and take enough \\ntime to see where the critical intervention is needed. There is no substitute for \\nexperience, nobody becomes a consultant overnight, but watch the best clinicians \\nat work and you will learn both practical and life skills.\\nMost important in an emergency situation is communication. Wherever you can, \\ninvolve the relatives and the whole team in discussions, but remember that at the \\nheart of this is a patient. What do they want? Never be afraid to ask the patient \\ndirectly, they may hold very strong views. However, it is up to us as physicians to \\nbe honest with them about their prognosis\\n—do not off er a treatment you know \\nis not in the best interests of the patient, and this includes resuscitation. When \\nfaced with death, many patients are afraid\\n—our role is to try to relieve that fear, \\nwhether by intervening to delay death, or by easing their passing. But we cannot \\never prevent death, we simply delay it. As Shakespeare has Julius Caesar say:\\n‘Of all the wonders that I have yet heard, it seems to me most strange that men \\nshould fear, seeing that death, a necessary end, will come when it will come. ’\\nIntroduction to emergencies\\nAirway P rotect cervical spine, if injury possible.\\n Assessment: any signs of obstruction?

NB: NOT if on a \\ue020-blocker. If no response, a further 5mg IV over 3min (if age \\n<60yrs). Alternatives: atenolol 2.5mg IV repeated at 5min intervals until 10mg given; \\nor amiodarone. If unsuccessful, use DC cardioversion.\\nAtrial ﬁ brillation/ ﬂ utter: Manage with rate control; seek help if resistant (p130).\\nAtrial tachycardia: Rare; may be due to digoxin toxicity: withdraw digoxin, consider \\ndigo\\nxin-speciﬁ c antibody fragments. Maintain K+ at 4–5mmol/L.\\nMultifocal atrial tachycardia: Most commonly occurs in COPD. Correct hypoxia and \\nhypercapnia. Consider verapamil if rate remains >110bpm.\\nJunctional tachycardia: Where anterograde conduction through the AV node oc-\\ncurs, vagal manoeuvres are worth trying. Adenosine will usually cardiovert a junc-\\ntional rhythm to sinus rhythm. If it fails or recurs, \\ue020-blockers (or verapamil\\n—not \\nwith \\ue020-blockers, digoxin, or class I agents such as quinidine).

Patients with \\nasthma or \\nCOPD may present with a sudden deterioration. Mechanically ventilated \\npatients can suddenly develop hypoxia or an increase in ventilation pressures.\\nSigns: Reduced expansion, hyper-resonance to percussion, and diminished breath \\nsounds on the aff \\nected side. With a tension pneumothorax, the trachea will be devi-\\nated away from the aff ected side and the patient will be very unwell.\\nTests \\ue007A CXR should not be performed if a tension pneumothorax is suspected, as \\nit will delay immediate necessary treatment. Otherwise, request an expiratory ﬁ lm, \\nand look for an area devoid of lung markings, peripheral to the edge of the collapsed \\nlung (see p\\n725). Ensure the suspected pneumothorax is not a large emphysematous \\nbulla. Check ABG in dyspnoeic/hypoxic patients and those with chronic lung disease.\\nManagement \\ue007See ﬁ g 19.14. Depends on whether it is a primary pneumothorax \\nor secondary (=underlying lung disease or smoker >50yrs old), size, and symptoms.9\\n  • Size is measured from the visible lung margin to chest wall at le vel of the hilum.\\n  • Pneumothorax due to trauma or mechanical ventilation requires a chest drain.\\n  • Aspiration of a pneumothorax, see p767.\\n  • Insertion and management of a chest drain, see p 766. Use a small tube ( 10–14F) \\nunless blood/pus is also present. Tubes may be removed 24h after the lung has re-\\nexpanded and air leak has stopped (ie the tube stops bubbling). This is done during \\nexpiration or a Valsalva manoeuvre.\\nSurgical advice: Arrange if: bilateral pneumothoraces; lung fails to expand within \\n48h of intercostal drain insertion; persistent air leak; two or more previous pneumo-\\nthoraces on the same side; or history of pneumothorax on the opposite side.\\n\\ue022Tension pneumothorax \\n \\ue022This is a medical emergency. (See ﬁ g 16.43, p749.)\\nEssence Air drawn into the pleural space with each inspiration has no route of \\nescape during e\\nxpiration. The mediastinum is pushed over into the contralateral \\nhemithorax, kinking and compressing the great veins. Unless the air is rapidly re-\\nmoved, cardiorespiratory arrest will occur.\\nSigns Respiratory distress, tachycardia, hypotension, distended neck veins, trachea \\nd\\neviated away from side of pneumothorax. Increased percussion note, reduced air \\nentry/breath sounds on the aff ected side.\\nTreatment\\nTo remove the air, insert a large-bore (14–16G) needle with a syringe, partially ﬁ lled \\nwith 0.9% saline, into the 2nd intercostal interspace in the midclavicular line on the \\nside of the suspected pneumothorax. Remove plunger to allow the trapped air to \\nbubble through the syringe (with saline as a water seal) until a chest tube can be \\nplaced. Alternatively, insert a large-bore Venﬂ on in the same location.\\n \\ue022Do this before requesting a CXR.\\n \\ue022Then insert a chest drain.

Non-convulsive status (eg absence status or continuous partial sei-\\nzures with preservation of consciousness) may be more diffi  cult: look for subtle eye \\nor lid movement.

Beware respiratory arrest during the \\nlast part of the injection. Have full resuscitation facilities to hand for all IV benzodi-\\nazepine use. The rectal route is an alternative for diazepam if IV access is diffi  cult.\\nBuccal midazolam is an easier to use oral alternative where no IV access (eg in \\na community setting); dose for those 10yrs old and older 10mg; if 1–5yrs 5mg, if \\n5–10yrs 7 . 5mg; squirt half the volume between the lower gum and the cheek on \\neach side.

Measure the opening pressure!\\nManagement \\ue007See ﬁ g 19.22. The goal is to \\ue001ICP and avert secondary injury. Urgent \\nneurosurgery is required for the deﬁ nitive treatment of \\ue000ICP from focal causes (eg \\nhaematomas). This is achieved via a craniotomy or burr hole. Also, an ICP monitor (or \\nbolt) may be placed to monitor pressure. Holding measures are listed in ﬁ g 19.22.\\nHerniation syndromes\\nUncal herniation is caused by a lateral supratentorial mass, which pushes the ipsi-\\nlat\\neral inferomedial temporal lobe (uncus) through the temporal incisura and against \\nthe midbrain. The IIIrd nerve, travelling in this space, gets compressed, causing a \\ndilated ipsilateral pupil, then ophthalmoplegia (a ﬁ xed pupil localizes a lesion poorly \\nbut is ‘ipsilateralizing’). This may be followed (quickly) by contralateral hemiparesis \\n(pressure on the cerebral peduncle) and coma from pressure on the ascending re-\\nticular activating system (\\nARAS) in the midbrain.\\nCerebellar tonsil herniation is caused by \\ue000pr essure in the posterior fossa forcing \\nthe cerebellar tonsils through the foramen magnum. Ataxia, VIth nerve palsies, and \\nupgoing plantar reﬂ  exes occur ﬁ rst, then loss of consciousness, irregular breathing, \\nand apnoea. This syndrome may proceed very rapidly given the small size of, and \\npoor compliance in, the posterior fossa.\\nSubfalcian (cingulate) herniation is caused by a frontal mass. The cingulate gyrus \\n(medial fr\\nontal lobe) is forced under the rigid falx cerebri. It may be silent unless the \\nanterior cerebral artery is compressed and causes a stroke —eg contralateral leg \\nweakness ± abulia (lack of decision-making).\\n_OHCM_10e.indb   830_OHCM_10e.indb   830 02/05/2017   19:0902/05/2017   19:09'),\n",

Ketoacidosis is an alternative metabolic pathway used in starva-\\ntion states; it is far less effi  cient, and produces acetone as a byproduct (hence the \\nfruity breath of patients in ketosis). In acute diabetic ketoacidosis, there is excessive \\nglucose, but because of a lack of insulin, this cannot be taken up into cells to be \\nmetabolized, so pushing the body into a starvation-like state where ketoacidosis \\nis the only mechanism of energy production. The combination of severe acidosis \\nand hyperglycaemia can be deadly, so early recognition and treatment is important.\\nTypical picture Gradual drowsiness, vomiting, and dehydration in type \\n1 diabetic \\n(very rarely type 2). \\ue007Do glucose in all those with unexplained vomiting, abdo pain, \\npolyuria, poly\\ndipsia, lethargy, anorexia, ketotic breath, dehydration, coma, or deep \\nbreathing (sighing ‘Kussmaul’ hyperventilation). Triggers: Infection, eg UTI; surgery; \\nMI; pancreatitis; chemotherapy; antipsychotics; wrong insulin dose/non-compliance.\\nDiagnosis\\n1\\n      Acidaemia (venous blood pH <7.3 or HCO3\\nΩ < 15.0mmol/L).\\n2       Hyperglycaemia (blood glucose >11.0mmol/L) or known DM.\\n3       Ketonaemia (≥3.0mmol/L) or signiﬁ cant ketonuria (more than 2+ on dipstick).\\nTests: ECG, CXR. Urine: Dipstick and MSU. Blood: Capillary and lab glucose, ketones, pH \\n(use v\\nenous blood; ABG only if \\ue001GCS or hypoxia), U&E, HCO3\\nΩ, osmolality, FBC, blood culture.\\nSevere DKA If one or more of the following features is present on admission, con-\\nsider tr\\nansfer to HDU/ICU for monitoring and central venous access.

Often there is no fever. Do MSU, blood cultures, and CXR. Start broad-\\nspectrum antibiotics (eg co-amoxiclav, p386) early if infection is suspected.\\n  • Cr eatinine. Some assays for creatinine cross-react with ketone bodies, so plasma \\ncr\\neatinine may not reﬂ ect true renal function.\\n  • Hyponatr aemia is common, due to osmolar compensation for the hyperglycaemia. \\n\\ue000 or \\ue009 [Na +] indicates severe water loss. As treatment commences Na + rises as \\nwater enters cells. Na+ is also low due to an artefact; corrected plasma [Na+] = Na+ \\n+ 2.4[(glucose Ω5.5)/5.5].\\n  • K etonuria does not equate with ketoacidosis. Anyone may have up to ++ketonuria \\nafter an overnight fast. Not all ketones are due to diabetes —consider alcohol if \\nglucose normal. Always check venous blood ketones.\\n  • R ecurrent ketoacidosis.  Blood glucose may return to normal long before ketones \\nar\\ne removed from the blood, and premature termination of insulin infusion may \\nlead to lack of clearance and return to DKA. This may be avoided by maintaining \\na constant rate of insulin infusion (with co-infusion of glucose 10% to maintain \\nplasma glucose at 6–10mmol/L) until blood ketones <0 . 6mmol/L and pH >7.3.\\n  • A cidosis but without gross elevation of glucose may occur, but consider overdose \\n(eg aspirin) and lactic acidosis (in elderly diabetics).\\n  • Serum am ylase is often raised (up to ≈10) and non-speciﬁ  c abdominal pain is com-\\nmon, even in the absence of pancreatitis.\\nComplications \\ue007Cerebral oedema (get help if sudden CNS decline), aspiration pneu-\\nmonia, hypokalaemia, hypo magnesaemia, hypophosphataemia, thromboembolism.\\nPrevention \\ue007Talk to the patient: evaluate compliance and educate about triggers.\\n_OHCM_10e.indb   832_OHCM_10e.indb   832 02/05/2017   19:0902/05/2017   19:09'),\n",

Was this a suicide attempt, if so was the act planned? What \\nprecautions against being f\\nound? Did the patient seek help afterwards? Does the \\npatient think the method was dangerous? Was there a ﬁ nal act (eg suicide note)?\\n  • Present intentions. Do the y still feel suicidal? Do they wish it had worked?\\n  • What problems led to the act: do they still exist?\\n  • Is ther\\ne a psychiatric disorder (depression, alcoholism, personality disorder, \\nschizophr\\nenia, dementia)?\\n  • What are the patient’s resources (friends, family, work, personality)?\\nThe assessment of suicide risk: The following \\ue000 chance of futur e suicide: original in-\\ntention was to die; present intention is to die; presence of psychiatric disorder; poor \\nresources; previous suicide attempts; socially isolated; unemployed; male; \\n>50yrs old. \\nSee OHCS p358.

If the patient is malnourished then 75mg/kg can kill.\\nSigns and symptoms None initially, or vomiting ± RUQ pain. Later: jaundice and \\nencephalopathy from liver damage (the main danger) ± acute kidney injury (AKI).\\nManagement General measures: See p 838. GI decontamination is recommended \\nin those presenting <4h after overdose: give activated charcoal 1g/kg (max 50g).\\n  • Glucose, U&E, LFT, INR, ABG, FBC, HCO3\\nΩ ; blood paracetamol level at 4h post-ingestion.\\n  • If <10–12h since overdose, not vomiting, and plasma paracetamol is above the line \\non the graph (see ﬁ g 19.26), start acetylcysteine.\\n  • If >8–24h and suspicion of large overdose ( >7.5g) err on the side of caution and \\nstart acetylcysteine, stopping it if level below treatment line and INR/ALT normal.\\n  • If ingestion time is unknown, or it is staggered, or presentation is >15h from inges-\\ntion, treatment may still help. \\ue007Get advice.\\nAcetylcysteine is given by IVI: 150mg/kg in 5% glucose over 15–60min; then 50mg/\\nkg in 500mL of 5% glucose over 4h; then 100mg/kg/16h in 1L of 5% glucose. Rash is a \\ncommon SE: treat with chlorphenamine + observe; do not stop unless anaphylatoid \\nreaction with shock, vomiting, and wheeze (occur <10%). An alternative (if acetyl-\\ncysteine unavailable) is methionine 2.5g/4h PO for 16h (total: 10g), but absorption is \\nunreliable if vomiting.\\nOngoing management\\n  • Next day do INR, U&E, LFT. If INR rising, continue acetylcysteine until <1.4.\\n  • If continued deterioration, discuss with the liver team. Don’t hesitate to get help.\\n  • Consider referral to specialist liver unit guided by eg King’s College criteria (BOX, p275).\\nSalicylate poisoning \\nAspirin is a weak acid with poor water solubility. It is present in many over-the-\\ncounter preparations. Uncoupling of oxidative phosphorylation leads to anaerobic \\nmetabolism and the production of lactate and heat. Eff  ects are dose related and \\npotentially fatal: •\\n150mg/kg: mild toxicity. •250mg/kg: moderate •>500mg/kg: severe \\ntoxicity. Levels over 700mg/L are potentially fatal.\\nSigns and symptoms Unlike paracetamol, there are many early features:\\n  • Vomiting, dehydration, hyperventilation, tinnitus, vertigo, sweating.\\n  • Rarely \\ue001GCS, seizures, \\ue001BP and heart block, pulmonary oedema, hyperthermia.\\nPatients present initially with respiratory alkalosis due to a direct stimulation of \\nthe central respiratory centres and then develop a metabolic acidosis. Hyper- or \\nhypoglycaemia may occur.\\nManagement Gener\\n al: (pp838–9.) Correct dehydration. Keep patient on ECG monitor. \\nGive activated charcoal to all presenting \\ue0051h—consider even if delayed presentation, \\nslow-release formations, or bezoar formation (can delay absorption): at least one dose \\nof \\n1g/kg (max 50g). Consider repeat doses (two further doses of 50g, 4h apart).\\n1       Bloods. Paracetamol and salicylate level, glucose, U&E, LFT, INR, ABG , HCO3\\nΩ, FBC. \\nSalicylate level may need to be repeated after 2h, due to continuing absorption \\nif a potentially toxic dose has been taken. Monitor blood glucose 1–2hrly, beware \\nhypoglycaemia, if severe poisoning, monitor salicylate levels, serum pH, and U&E.\\n2       Urine. Check pH, consider catheterization to monitor output and pH.\\n3       Corr ect acidosis. If plasma salicylate level >500mg/L (3.6mmol/L) or severe \\nmetabolic acidosis, consider alkalinization of the urine, eg with 1.5L 1.26% so-\\ndium bicarbonate IV over 3h. Aim for urine pH 7.5–8.

Use Lund and Browder charts (see ﬁ g 19.27) or the \\n‘rule of nines’ (arm: 9%; front of trunk 18%; head and neck 9%; leg 18%; back of trunk \\n18%; perineum 1%). Ignore erythema. Burn depth determines healing time/scarring; \\nassessing this can be har\\nd, even for the experienced. The big distinction is whether \\nthe burn is partial thickness (painful, red, and blistered) or full thickness (insensate/\\npainless; grey-white). NB: burns can evolve, particularly over the ﬁ rst 48h.\\nResuscitation Resuscitate and arrange transfer to specialist burns unit for all major \\nburns (>25% partial thickness in adults and >20% in children). Assess site, size, and \\ndepth of burn (ﬁ g 19.27, to help calculate ﬂ uid requirements). Referral is still war-\\nranted in cases of full thickness burns >5%, partial thickness burns >10% in adults or \\n>5% in children or the elderly, burns of special sites, chemical and electrical burns, \\nand burns with inhalational injury.\\n  • Airw ay: Beware of upper airway obstruction developing if hot gases inhaled. Sus-\\npect if hist\\nory of ﬁ re in enclosed space, soot in oral/nasal cavity, singed nasal hairs \\nor hoarse voice. A ﬂ exible laryngo/bronchoscopy is useful. Involve anaesthetists \\nearly and consider early intubation. Obstruction can develop in the ﬁ rst 24h.\\n  • Br eathing: Exclude life-threatening chest injuries (eg tension pneumothorax) and \\nconstricting burns—consider escharotomy if chest burns are impairing thorax ex-\\ncursion (OHCS p766). Give 100% O2. Suspect carbon monoxide poisoning (p842) from \\nhistory, cherry-red skin, and carboxyhaemoglobin level (COHb). With 100% O2 t½ \\nof COHb falls from 250min to 40min (consider hyperbaric O2 if: pH<7.1; CNS signs; \\n>25% COHb or >20% if pregnant). SpO2 (oxim etry) is unreliable in CO poisoning.\\n  • Cir culation: Partial thickness burns >10% in a child and >15% in adults require IV \\nﬂ uid resuscitation. Put up 2 large-bore (14G or 16G) IV lines. Do not worry if you have \\nto put these through burned skin; intraosseous access is valuable in infants and \\ncan be used in adults (see \\nOHCS p236). Secure them well: they are literally lifelines.\\nUse a burns calculator ﬂ ow chart or a formula, eg: Parkland formula (popular): 4 ≈ \\nweight (kg) ≈ % burn = mL Hartmann’s solution in 24h, half given in 1st 8h. Replace ﬂ u-\\nid from the time of burn, not from the time ﬁ rst seen in hospital. Formulae are only \\nguides: adjust IVI according to clinical response and urine output; aim for 0.5mL/kg/h \\n(1mL/kg/h in children), ~50% more in electrical burns and inhalation injury. Monitor \\nT° (core and surface); catheterize the bladder. Beware of over-resuscitation (‘ﬂ uid \\ncreep’) which can lead to complications such as abdominal compartment syndrome.\\nTreatment ‘Cool the burn, warm the patient.’ Do no t apply cold water to extensive \\nburns for long periods: this may intensify shock. Take care with circumferential full-\\nthickness burns of the limbs as compartment syndrome may develop rapidly particu-\\nlarly after ﬂ uid resuscitation. Decompress (escharotomy and fasciotomy) as needed. \\nIf transferring to a burns unit, do not burst blisters or apply any special creams as \\nthis can hinder assessment. Simple saline gauze or paraffi   n gauze is suitable; cling \\nﬁ lm is useful as a temporary measure and relieves pain. Titrate morphine \\nIV for good \\nanalgesia. Ensure tetanus immunity. Antibiotic prophylaxis is not routinely used.\\nDeﬁ nitiv e dressings There are many dressings for partial thickness burns, eg bio-\\nlogical (pigskin, cada\\nveric skin), synthetic, and silver sulfadi azine cream alone or \\nwith cerium nitrate as Flammacerium®; it forms a leathery eschar which resists \\ninfection. Major full-thickness burns beneﬁ t from early tangential excision and split-\\nskin grafts as the burn is a major source of inﬂ ammatory cytokines and forms a rich \\nmedium for bacterial growth.\\n_OHCM_10e.indb   846_OHCM_10e.indb   846 02/05/2017   19:0902/05/2017   19:09'),\n",

It is essential to rewarm (see ‘Treatment’ later in topic) and re-examine.\\nDiagnosis Check oral or axillary T°. If ordinary thermometer shows <36.5°C, use a \\nlow-reading one PR. Is the rectal temperature <35°C? Infra-red ear thermometers \\ncan accurately reﬂ ect core temperature.\\nTests Urgent U&E, plasma glucose, and amylase. Thyroid function tests; FBC; blood \\ncultures. Consider blood gases. The ECG may show J-waves (ﬁ g 19.28).\\nTreatment Use ABCDE approach (p779)—but don’t expose to cold.\\n  • All patients should receive warm, humidiﬁ ed O2; ventilate if comatose or respira-\\ntory insuffi  ciency.\\n  • Remove wet clothing, slowly rewarm, aiming for rise of ½°C/h (check t emperature, \\nBP, HR, and respiratory rate every 30min) using blankets or active external warm-\\ning (hot air duvets). If T° rising too quickly stop and allow to cool slightly. Rapid \\nrewarming causes peripheral vasodilation and shock. A falling BP can be a sign of \\ntoo rapid warming.\\n  • Warm IVI.\\n  • Cardiac monitor is essential (AF, VF, and VT can occur at any time during rewarming \\nor on stimulation).\\n  • Consider antibiotics for the prevention of pneumonia (p166). Give these routinely in \\npatients over 65yrs with T° <32°C.\\n  • Consider urinary catheter (to monitor renal function).\\nNB: in sudden hypothermia from immersion or profound hypothermia with cardiovas-\\ncular instability/cardiac arrest, the temperature needs to be raised rapidly. Options \\ninclude warmed ﬂ  uid lavage (intravesical, nasogastric, intrapleural, intraperitoneal) \\nand intravascular warming (cardiopulmonary bypass, dialysis). In the event of car-\\ndiac arrest, deﬁ  brillation is usually unsuccessful if \\nT° <30°C (consider amiodarone, \\nbretylium). Resuscitation must continue until core T° >33°C (OHCS p786).\\nComplications Arrhythmias (if there is a cardiac arrest continue resuscitating until \\nT° >33°C, as cold brains are less damaged by hypoxia); pneumonia; pancreatitis; AKI; \\nDIC.

Bod-\\nies can be thr\\nown and sustain injuries on landing.\\n3       Missiles: Penetration or laceration from missiles are by far the commonest \\ninjuries. Missiles arise fr\\nom the bomb or are secondary, eg glass.\\n4       Flash burns: These are usually superﬁ  cial and occur on exposed skin.\\n5       Crush injuries: Beware sudden death or acute kidney injury from rhabdomy-\\noly\\nsis after release.\\n6       Cont amination: There is increasing concern about the use of biological or radi-\\noactiv\\ne material in terrorist bombs. Even domestic or industrial blasts can scat-\\nter chemicals widely and cause both superﬁ cial and penetrating contamination. \\nConsider the location and mechanism of the blast, and seek advice.\\n7       Ps ychological injury:  Eg post-traumatic stress disorder (OHCS p353).\\nTreatment: Approach the same as any major trauma ( OHCS p778). Rest and\\nobserve any suspected of exposure to signiﬁ cant blast but without other injury. \\nGun-shot injury: see OHCS p789. Major blast injuries, whatever the cause, should be \\nreported to the police for investigation.\\nBlast injuries\\n_OHCM_10e.indb   851_OHCM_10e.indb   851 02/05/2017   19:0902/05/2017   19:09'),\n",

Ask someone to call the arrest team and bring the \\ndeﬁ brillat\\nor. Note the time. ABC:\\n \\ue022Airway: Head tilt (if no spine injury) and chin lift/jaw thrust.\\n \\ue022Breathing: Look, listen, and feel for breathing for no more than 10 seconds. If there \\nis any doubt whether breathing is normal, proceed to chest compressions.\\n \\ue022Chest compressions: Place the heel of one hand on the centre of the chest (lower \\nhalf of the st\\nenum). Place your second hand on top and interlock ﬁ  ngers. Use \\nstraight arms. Give compressions at a rate of 100–120/min. Aim to compress the \\nsternum 5–6cm. After 30 compressions give 2 rescue breaths. Do not interrupt \\ncompressions >10s. Continue with a ratio of 30:2 until deﬁ brillator is available.\\nAdvanced life support See algorithm ﬁ g A3.\\n  • Continue chest compressions while adhesive deﬁ  brillation/ monitoring pads are \\nput in place. Plan all actions before pausing chest compressions.\\n  • Stop chest compression for <5s to assess rhythm. Determine whether the rhythm is \\nshockable (VF/pulseless VT) or non-shockable (asystole, pulseless electrical activity).\\nShockable rhythm: VF/pulseless VT\\n \\ue022A single person performs uninterrupted chest compressions while everyone else \\nprepares for deﬁ brillation: stand clear, move oxygen delivery device \\n1m away.\\n \\ue022Select the appropriate energy on the deﬁ brillator (150J or manufacturer's guide-\\nlines). When deﬁ brillator is charged and safety check complete, the rescuer per-\\nforming chest compressions stands clear and the shock is delivered.\\n \\ue022CPR is resumed immediately (30:2). Reassess pulse/rhythm only after 2 minutes of CPR.\\n \\ue022Repeat if shockable rhythm remains. Give drugs after 3 shocks (see Drugs, this topic).\\nNon-shockable rhythm: asystole/pulseless electrical activity (PEA)\\n \\ue022Continue CPR 30:2. Obtain IV access and secure airway. Once airway secure switch \\nto continuous compressions and ventilation. Give adrenaline 1mg IV.\\n \\ue022Check rhythm every 2 minutes.\\n \\ue022Consider reversible causes (4HS and 4TS: hypoxia, hypovolaemia, hyper/hypokalae-\\nmia/other metabolic derangement, hypothermia, thrombosis, tension pneumotho-\\nrax, tamponade, toxins).\\nDrugs\\n  • Give adrenaline \\n1mg IV every 3–5 mins for both shockable (from 3rd shock) and non-\\nshockable rhythms. In practice this means at every other rhythm check or shock.1\\n  • In shockable rhythms give amiodarone 300mg IV after 3 deﬁ brillation attempts. \\nConsider a further 150mg IV after 5 shocks. Lidocaine is an alternative.\\nDiscontinuing resuscitation Needs clinical judgement: what is the likelihood of \\nachieving a success\\nful return of spontaneous circulation? If there is a shockable \\nrhythm or a reversible cause then attempts are usually continued. It is reasonable \\nto discontinue if asystole \\n>20mins without a reversible cause.
